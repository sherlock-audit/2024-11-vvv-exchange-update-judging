# user may be dosed if his wallet nonce is 0

### Summary

The claim function checks if a wallets nonce is <= the nonce stored on the contract. In the edge case where a wallets nonce is 0, the wallet will be dosed from claiming and using the signature given to them by the signer.

### Root Cause

in VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol ln 106
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106

There exists a `claim` function that allows users to claim rewards/ tokens. The strange part is the check below...
```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
```
The function call will revert if the params nonce is less than or equal to the nonces stored for the kyc address. The problem occurs because the default value of `nonces[_params.kycAddress]` is 0 and if the wallet has yet to make a tx its nonce will also be 0. When the signer goes to sign the signature for the wallet, the nonce included will be 0 and will fail to pass this check. The user will be dosed from claiming rewards.

It can be observed that the nonce is based from the wallets nonce based on the comments from the event below
```solidity
    /**
        @notice Emitted when a user claims tokens
        @param kycAddress Address of the user's KYC wallet
        @param projectTokenAddress Address of the project token to be claimed
        @param projectTokenProxyWallets Addresses of the wallets from which the project token is to be claimed
        @param tokenAmountsToClaim Amounts of project tokens claimed from each wallet
        @param nonce KYC-wallet-based nonce
     */
```
as we can see the nonce is kyc wallet-based nonce. Therefore there  is a case where this nonce can be 0 and dos the user from claiming.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. the kyc wallet has not made any tx yet
2. the kycwallet nonce is 0

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. a user has yet to make a tx on the kyc wallet, his nonce is 0
2. the user wants to claim and the signature is formed and signed by the signer included the nonce of the wallet which is 0
3. the user goes to claim with nonce == 0 and cannot because of the if statement below
```solidity
if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
```

### Impact

Rewards are locked 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change the logic to not be inclusive as nonces start at 0. the logic below should fix the issue
```solidity
if (_params.nonce < nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
```
