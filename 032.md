# Protocol does not comply with EIP712

### Summary

The `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contract is expected to comply with EIP712, however, the signature digest is not encoded correctly. As a result, correct signatures, compliant with EIP712, will not pass the validation in `_isSignatureValid`.  

### Root Cause

In the `_isSignatureValid` function of `VVVVCTokenDistributor` `projectTokenProxyWallets` and `tokenAmountsToClaim`, which are arrays, are not encoded as required in the EIP: 'The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents (i.e. the encoding of SomeType[5] is identical to that of a struct containing five members of type SomeType).'.

This is how they are currently encoded: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L162C13-L172C18 


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Signer generates a valid signature through an EIP712 tool.
2. Even though the signature is valid, it will not pass `_isSignatureValid` and calling `claim` with that signature will revert.

### Impact

A valid signature, compliant to EIP712, will not pass validation in ï»¿`VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Encode the arrays as the `keccak256` hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents, as noted in the EIP.
