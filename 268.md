# Lack of investmentRounds[] validation checking while authorized entity want to add multiple investment records to the ledger can introduces significant risks to both investors and the system's integrity

### Summary

investmentRounds is not compared among off-chain specified rounds which was controlled from off-chain mechanism when `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:addInvestmentRecords()` is called  thus can introduces significant risks to both investors and the system's integrity.

---

### Root Cause

The issue occurs in the function `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:addInvestmentRecords()` (L268-L276) [link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L268-L276).


---

### Vulnerability Details

When an Authorized entity is added multiple investment records to the ledger there is no validation check on `_investmentRounds[i]`. The investmentRounds must need to be bounded according to the off-chain specified investmentRounds. And This lack of validation or misconfigured investmentRounds can introduces significant risks to both investors and the system's integrity such as Disruption of Investment Tracking, Violation of Round Timeframes, Breach of Investor Confidence, Token Distribution Issues, Security Exploitation, Legal and Compliance Risks etc.

-  Authorized entity can Mistaken or arbitrary changes to investment rounds can lead to financial, reputational, and operational risks.

---

 ### POC

Suppose in the off-chain mechanism the specified investmentRounds is set from index 1 to 100 and an Authorized entity is added investment records `investmentRounds[i] = 150`, which is not expected . It is possible to add multiple investment records, though this is very unlikely if we consider the  Authorized entity modifier is sensible enough. But we can not rely on this assumption that a human won't make a mistake. While added multiple investment records this mistake can happen accidentally which will cause significant risks to both investors and the system's integrity. There's a off-chain restriction on `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:invest()` function which is not the case for `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:addInvestmentRecords()` function.

### Impact

Though Likelihood is low but the impact is critical causing can lead to financial, reputational, and operational risks.

### Recommendations

While adding multiple investment records every investmentRounds must be checked and validated.

Add the following code before the `L268` of `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:addInvestmentRecords()`. 

```solidity

// Validate that all investment rounds are valid
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _investmentRounds.length; i++) {
        bool isValid = false;
        for (uint256 j = 0; j < sampleInvestmentRoundIds.length; j++) {
            if (_investmentRounds[i] == sampleInvestmentRoundIds[j]) {
                isValid = true;
                break; // Exit the loop when a match is found
            }
        }
        if (!isValid) {
            revert InvalidInvestmentRound(_investmentRounds[i]);
        }
    }
```
