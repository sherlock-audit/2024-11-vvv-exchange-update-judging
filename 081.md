# `claim()` is frontrunnable

### Summary

`VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol`'s [`claim()`](https://github.com/vvvdevs/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/blob/29fdceaeed9a4174039b66d85a5d4ce5d0ed14bf/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106) function data can be captured from the mempool and frontrun by any address.

### Root Cause

[`claim()`](https://github.com/vvvdevs/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/blob/29fdceaeed9a4174039b66d85a5d4ce5d0ed14bf/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106) does not ensure that `msg.sender` is the rightful claimant of the project tokens. As a result, anyone who passes the correct `_params` data to `claim()` will receive project tokens according to the data. 

Depending on the chain, this `_params` data may be visible in the mempool before it's executed. On Ethereum, for instance, the order in which transactions take precedence is determined by the amount of gas sent with a transaction. If the data from this transaction is copied from the mempool, passed into `claim()`, and called from a different address along with a higher gas value, that transaction will execute before the authentic one.

### Attack Path

1. Monitor the mempool for a transaction sent to `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol`'s address with the sighash of `claim()`.
2. Copy the transaction data and replace the authentic address with a malicious one.
3. Send the malicious transaction with a higher gas value than the authentic one (this will be visible in the transaction data).
4. The transaction will execute, and all the project tokens will be sent to the malicious address.

### Impact

On any chains on which this is possible, all project tokens are potentially lost.

### Mitigation

`_params.kycAddress` should be passed into `safeTransferFrom()` instead of `msg.sender`. If `kycAddress` is not the intended recipient address, then it should be ensured that `claim()` cannot be called from any address but the intended one.
