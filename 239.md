# USDT enabling Fee on Transfer will break protocol calculations

### Summary

As of now USDT has Fee on Transfer feature that is disabled. Whenever they enable it in the future this could cause unexpected issues for the protocol that will result in loss of funds.

### Root Cause

If the FoT implementation of USDT gets enabled while a round of investment is ongoing, users that invest USDT will break protocol fee variables. 

How will that happen? 

Fee on transfer in USDT deducts the fee from the transaction tokens. That means that whenever someone invests 100 USDT, the protocol receives 100 - fee.

As of now the fee that the protocol is taking is calculated based on exact prevFeeAmount. With FoT prevFeeAmount will not be exact but rather prevFeeAmount - fee. If the fee for USDT is larger than the fee of the protocol, the protocol will suffers loses from its own balance.

This will result in loss of funds for the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. protocol has ongoing investment round for USDT
2. User invests USDT in the protocol

### External pre-conditions

1. USDT enables FoT

### Attack Path

1. protocol has ongoing investment round for USDT
2. USDT enables FoT
3. User invests USDT in the protocol(depending on the fee protocol loses this funds) 

### Impact

Protocol suffers loss of funds depending on the fee on transfer.
Losses will be encountered with every invest() till reaching of total invest cap for the round.
This could result in massive losses for the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is not trivial.
