# Fixed `exchangeRateDenominator` Can Result in Incorrect Calculations in Certain Situations, Preventing Users from Investing or Causing the Investment Round to Reach Its Limit Prematurely

## Description  

In the [VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L137-L205) function, the following formula is used to convert Payment Tokens to USDC/USDT or another stablecoin:

```javascript
    preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;
```

If the [exchangeRateDenominator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L36-L37) is less than the decimals of the payment token, it may result in an inability to accurately convert payment tokens into the stablecoin equivalent. For example, consider the following scenario:

The `exchangeRateDenominator` is set to `1e6` (as defined in the [test suite](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/test/vc/VVVVCTestBase.sol#L61)), and the payment token amount is `1 ETH`. We attempt to convert this to its USDC equivalent, where `1 ETH` equals `3000e6` USDC. The conversion fails because no multiplication of `1e18` can produce `3000e6` USDC under these conditions:

```javascript
    (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;
    (1e18 * 3) / 1e6 = 3e12; // Results in an incorrect value. correct value should be 3000e6
```

Similarly, if `exchangeRateDenominator` is set to `1e18`, conversion also fails when the payment token has decimals greater than 18. For instance, if there is a `someToken` with 30 decimals and its USDC equivalent is `1000e6`:

```javascript
    (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;
    (1e30 * 1) / 1e18 = 1e12; // Results in an incorrect value. correct value should be 1000e6
```

In these cases, incorrect investment amounts in USDC terms can lead to investment rounds reaching their limit prematurely without receiving the actual amount of payment tokens corresponding to the calculated value. Alternatively, the calculated amount may exceed the `kycAddressAllocation` limit, causing the `invest()` function to revert.

## Impact  

- **Damage:** Medium  
- **Likelihood:** Low/Medium (depends on the dev awareness and understanding of math)

**Impact Details:** Incorrect calculations can cause investment rounds to reach their limits much faster without receiving the corresponding amount of payment tokens. Alternatively, users may be unable to invest because the calculated post-fee stable amount exceeds the [kycAddressAllocation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L67) limit and also it can exceed [investment round limit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L62), [leading to revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L175-L180).

## Proof of Concept  

**Attack Path:**  

- text based examples/scenarios provided description part of this report.

**POC:**  

Add the following test inside `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.unit.t.sol`.

This POC demonstrates that if `exchangeRateDenominator` is set to `1e6` (the value set by the dev in test suite) and a user invests `1 ETH`, it will result in an incorrect `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`. This leads to a revert due to exceeding the KYC address allocation limit and the investment round limit.

```javascript
    // run the test with: "forge test --match-test test_FixedExchangeRateDenominator_ResultsInWrongCalculations -vvv"
    function test_FixedExchangeRateDenominator_ResultsInWrongCalculations_LeadingToRevert() external {

        // 1. setup

        // `exchangeRateDenominator` is set to 1e6 in the test suite by dev
        uint256 investmentRound = 1; 
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit = 3000e6; // 1 ETH == 3000 USDC
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp = block.timestamp + 86400; // 1 day
        address kycAddress = user;
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation = 3000e6; // 1 ETH
        uint256 amountToInvest = 1e18; // 1 ETH
        uint256 exchangeRateNumerator = 3;
        uint256 feeNumerator = 100; // %1
        
        // construct valid Invest parameters plus signature
        VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature({
            _investmentRound: investmentRound,
            _investmentRoundLimit: investmentRoundLimit,
            _investmentAmount: amountToInvest,
            _investmentAllocation: kycAddressAllocation,
            _exchangeRateNumerator: exchangeRateNumerator,
            _feeNumerator: feeNumerator,
            _kycAddress: kycAddress,
            _investmentRoundStartTimestamp: investmentRoundStartTimestamp,
            _investmentRoundEndTimestamp: investmentRoundEndTimestamp
        });


        // 2. User wants to invest 1 ETH (3000 USDC), but the following calculations (#L169-L171)
        //    result in exceeding the maximum limit for the KYC address allocation and the round limit,
        //    causing a revert.

        //    Formula to calculate the pre-fee stablecoin equivalent:

        //    amountToInvest * exchangeRateNumerator / exchangeRateDenominator
        //    1e18 * 3 / 1e6 = 3e12 (3000 USDC represented as 3e12, which is incorrect amount)

        //    Formula to calculate the post-fee stablecoin equivalent:

        //    preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - ((preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR)
        //    3e12 - ((3e12 * 100) / 10000) = 297e10 (297e10 representing 2970 USDC, which is not the correct amount)

        //   postFeeStableAmountEquivalent (297e10) exceeds round limit (3000e6) and kyc address max allocation limit (3000e6), leading to revert.
        vm.startPrank(user);

            vm.expectRevert();
            LedgerInstance.invest(params);

        vm.stopPrank();

    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation  

- add a mapping in the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contract to store the `exchangeRateDenominator` for each payment token.
