# Unauthorized Investment on Behalf of KYC Addresses


### Summary
The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contract allows any user to invest on behalf of a KYC address without their permission, as long as they have access to a valid signature. The contract fails to verify that the transaction sender is the intended KYC address or an allowed address from the KYC address's wallet.

### Root Cause
The [`invest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L137-L205) function only validates the signature against the KYC address specified in the parameters but doesn't verify that `msg.sender` is the same as the `kycAddress` in the parameters or someone allowed. This allows anyone to execute investments for any KYC address.

### Internal pre-conditions
- Valid signature from authorized signer
- Active investment round
- KYC address hasn't reached allocation limit
- Total round investment limit not reached

### External pre-conditions
- Access to a valid signature (from mempool or past transactions)
- Sufficient payment tokens to execute the investment

### Attack Path
1. Attacker monitors for investment transactions containing valid parameters 
2. Attacker extracts the parameters
3. Attacker can submit their own transaction using the same parameters
4. Investment is recorded for the original KYC address, even though they didn't initiate it

### Impact
**Medium**
- No direct fund loss as:
  - Investments are still properly tracked for the KYC address
  - Only admins can withdraw funds
  - Investment limits are enforced
- However, it can:
  - Disrupt off-chain accounting/tracking
  - Force unwanted investments on KYC addresses
  - Interfere with user's investment strategy
  - Create confusion in investment records

### Mitigation
Add a check in the `invest()` function to ensure the sender is allowed to use the signature.
