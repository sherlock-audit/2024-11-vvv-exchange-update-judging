# Project tokens can be stolen by the attacker with frontrunning

### Summary

Project tokens can be stolen by the attacker with frontrunning

### Root Cause

In [VVVVCTokenDistributor Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106C1-L145C6), project tokens can be stolen by the attacker with frontrunning attack vector due to missing `msg.sender` check.

In the comment line, it states that any address which is in alias of KYC address has ability of claim their tokens with trusted-system generated signature. But current we don't have any check about `msg.sender` in `claim()` function which makes the function vulnerable against the frontrunning issues.

> @notice Allows any address which is an alias of a KYC address to claim tokens across multiple rounds which provide that token


The `claim()` function checks various validations such as signature, deadline or paused but it has to check the `msg.sender` because it directly sends the tokens through `msg.sender` address.

```solidity
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        if (claimIsPaused) {
            revert ClaimIsPaused();
        }

        if (_params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length != _params.tokenAmountsToClaim.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

        // define token to transfer
        IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);

        // @audit Steal the funds, it doesn't check who is msg.sender - High

        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
&>              msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

        emit VCClaim(
            _params.kycAddress,
            _params.projectTokenAddress,
            _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
            _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
            _params.nonce
        );
    }
```


### External pre-conditions

1. Legit user who has alias of a KYC address should try to claim tokens with system generated signature

### Attack Path

1. User wants to claim his tokens and get a signature from the system
2. User sends the transaction with the correct parameters and signature
3. Attacker sees the user's transaction in the mempool and sends the same transaction with more gas
4. Attacker steals the user's tokens

### Impact

High - The vulnerability is directly causing loss of funds/yield which makes the severity High. 

### Mitigation

Do not send the tokens directly to `msg.sender`, ensure that `msg.sender` has permission to claim those tokens
