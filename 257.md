# DOS vulnerability in loops with unbounded array

### Summary

When malicious user calls the `claim()` function with `n` numbers of the **projectTokenProxyWallet** it will result in the increase of gas price which will cause problems to other users as they have to pay more gas prices for claiming.

### Root Cause

There should be a check on the number of addresses present in the `params.projectTokenProxyWallets` so it should not execute all together.

If there is more number of addresses present it takes more time and will result in increase of the gas price for other transaction to happen.
