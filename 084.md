# Polkadot Ecosystem Incompatibility

**Vulnerability Details**
Solidity contracts cannot be deployed directly on Polkadot due to architectural differences. Polkadot's Substrate framework requires ink! smart contracts, and its main relay chain lacks native EVM support.

**Impact**
Deployment on Polkadot completely fails, leaving the contract code unusable and potentially requiring a system architecture redesign.
**Recommended Mitigation**
Implement Polkadot-specific solution using Moonbeam or ink!
