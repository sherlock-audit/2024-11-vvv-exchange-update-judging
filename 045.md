# `VVVVCTokenDistributor` Can Be Drained If A Zero Nonce Is Used

### Summary

If a `ClaimParams.signature` is signed using a `nonce` value of `0`, the contract can be drained.

### Root Cause

The `VVVVCTokenDistributor` uses a `nonce` to enforce that a `ClaimParams` signature can never be reused (since this would allow a user to repeatedly claim).

However, the implementation is incorrect:

```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L115C9-L124C52

If `_params.nonce` is `0` for an uninitialized `nonces[_params.kycAddress]`, the signature will be considered valid, since:

```solidity
_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress] // == 0 <= 0 ✅
nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce; // == 0 = 0 ✅
```

Since we are writing a `0` back to `nonces[_params.kycAddress]`, the blocking condition of `_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]` can always be bypassed.

Therefore, a valid signature with a zero nonce can replayed into perpetuity, allowing the approved claimant to continue claiming repeatedly, since the function uses the signature as the only means of access control for an otherwise permissionless caller.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Signer makes an approval to an account which uses a nonce of `0` and specifies that it is claimable for a non-zero amount of tokens.

### Attack Path

1. Signer generates valid claim signature for Alice using a zero nonce.
2. Alice executes the transaction and claims tokens. Alice notices that her stored nonce is still zero.
3. Alice executes the transaction and claims tokens. 
4. Alice executes the transaction and claims tokens...

### Impact

The contract can be drained of approved token balances for rightful claimants.

### Mitigation

Ensure that when first receiving a nonce that it is equal to what is currently in state (not less than or equal), then ensure this value is always incremented when the signature is consumed to prevent the transaction from being replayed.
