# Lack of updating signer address functionality may make contract of no use

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

In VVVVCInvestmentLedger & VVVVCTokenDistributor contract the signer address is responsible to sign the investment tx. While checking the validity of the signature that signer address is compared with recovered address. That signer address is set only once, while deploying the contract, there is no other way to change the signer address in future. The problem may arise if an EOA is intended to use for the signer. In that case there will be a private key for that EOA. If by mistake the key is lost then there is no way to change the signer address to a new signer because  those 2 contract does not have such functionality to change address. It means after loosing the private key if new EOA signs the investment tx then the signature will not match i.e the recovered address will not be the same as currently set signer address in contract, as a result all tx will revert for `invest()` & `claim()`. 

### Internal pre-conditions

The signer set through constructor is an EOA.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

None.

### Impact

Contracts can't be used.

### Mitigation

Have an admin controlled function to update the signer address in future if needed.
