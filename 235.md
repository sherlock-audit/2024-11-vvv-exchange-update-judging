# Replayable Signatures Allow Investments with Outdated Exchange Rates and Fee Values

### Summary

The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest(...)` function lacks nonce-based replay protection, which allows the reuse of the same signature within the same investment round's deadline. While the deadline mitigates indefinite signature reuse, a user can still exploit the absence of a nonce to repeatedly invest with outdated fee and exchange rate values during the valid period of a signature. Specifically:

- `_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator` determines the token-to-stablecoin exchange rate.
- `_params.feeNumerator` calculates the fees.

This can lead to the following scenarios within the same round:

1. **Fee Bypass**: A user could reuse an old signature with no fee, even if fees are applied later within the round.
2. **Exchange Rate Exploit**: If the `exchangeRateNumerator` becomes less favorable, the user could repeatedly invest at the previously favorable rate using the same signature.

### Root Cause

The signatures lack a nonce, allowing the same signature to be reused within the deadline.

---

### Internal pre-conditions

The attack leverages the absence of a maximum limit for the `deadline`. Since neither the contest page nor the code specifies a cap, it is assumed that the `deadline` can be arbitrarily large, increasing the window for exploitation.

---

### External pre-conditions

This issue is particularly significant for volatile tokens whose market prices fluctuate frequently. Additionally, the replayable fee parameter poses a risk since there is no guarantee—either in the code or the contest documentation—that fee values will remain constant throughout a round. Therefore, it is assumed that fees may vary within a single investment round.

---

### Attack Path

1. A user initially invests `1 wBTC` at an exchange rate of `80000 USDC / wBTC`, increasing their balance in the `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` mapping by `80000`.
2. Later in the same round, the exchange rate changes to `78000 USDC / wBTC`. To invest `80000 USDC` again, the user would now need to pay `~1.02 wBTC`.
3. By reusing the old signature within the valid deadline, the user invests `1 wBTC` again and improperly increases their balance by `80000`.

Similarly, the user could avoid paying new fees if the old signature lacks a fee numerator.

---

### Impact

User can replay the same signature and invest with old parameters.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_UserCanInvestWithSameSignatureBySignatureReplay() public {
    VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature(
        sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0],
        investmentRoundSampleLimit,
        sampleAmountsToInvest[0],
        userPaymentTokenDefaultAllocation,
        exchangeRateNumerator,
        feeNumerator,
        sampleKycAddress,
        activeRoundStartTimestamp,
        activeRoundEndTimestamp
    );

    uint256 preInvestBalance = PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser);

    // First investment using the signature
    investAsUser(sampleUser, params);

    // Exchange rate changes, requiring more tokens for the same investment
    // Replay the old signature to bypass the new rate
    investAsUser(sampleUser, params);

    // Assert contract and user balances reflect both investments
    assertTrue(PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(address(LedgerInstance)) == params.amountToInvest * 2);
    assertTrue((PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser) + params.amountToInvest * 2) == preInvestBalance);
}
```

### Mitigation

Introduce a nonce mechanism to ensure each signature is used only once, even within the same investment round's deadline. This would prevent signature replay during the valid period of a signature.
