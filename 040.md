# Lack of integer bounds on the immutable variable `exchangeRateDenominator` leads to incorrect calculations in `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` and `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`

### Summary

The variable `exchangeRateDenominator` is not bounded to a specific range which may lead to incorrect calculations when calculating the fees in `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` and consequently in `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`.
### Root Cause

The variable [`exchangeRateDenominator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L124) isn't bound to a specific range which leads to incorrect fee calculations when set to an incorrect figure either maliciously or by mistake by the deployer of `VVVVCInvestmentLedger`.

Given that immutable variables in Solidity can only be set once, this can be particularly devastating as it leads to either very high or very low fee calculations when calculating [`preFeeStableAmountEquivalent`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L165) and consequently in [`postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L169) which uses `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` for its calculations.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin/deployer of `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` needs to set `_exchangeRateDenominator` to a very high or very low figure during contract deployment.

### External pre-conditions

A user invokes the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` with valid parameters while the `exchangeRateDenominator` is set to an unreasonable value.

### Attack Path

1. The deployer of `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` sets `exchangeRateDenominator` to an extremely high or low value during contract deployment.
2. An investor calls `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` with valid params as defined in the struct `InvestParams`
3. Calculation Distortion: 
- For a low `exchangeRateDenominator`, `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` becomes disproportionately large:

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / 1; // Example low denominator
```

- For a low `exchangeRateDenominator`, the value is rendered negligible:

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / 10**18; // Example high denominator
```

### Impact

If `exchangeRateDenominator` is too low, the pre-fee equivalent will be inflated, leading to overestimated investment values. Conversely, if it is too high, the calculated equivalent becomes negligibly small, potentially misrepresenting the actual value of the investment and disrupting fee calculations.

### Mitigation

Add a range check for `_exchangeRateDenominator` during contract deployment, e.g 

```solidity
require(_exchangeRateDenominator > MIN_DENOMINATOR && _exchangeRateDenominator < MAX_DENOMINATOR, "Invalid denominator");
```
