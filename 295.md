# Reorg attacks can be exploited to claim tokens twice

### Summary

Chain reorganizations (reorgs) occur when a blockchain temporarily forks, In smart contracts designed for token claims, or reliance solely on onchain nonce and signature validity can lead to vulnerabilities. An attacker may exploit a reorg to claim tokens twice, resulting in unauthorized token distribution.

### Root Cause

The fact that nonces are stored onchain, means that in the event of a chain reorg, an attacker or malicious user can claim twice.
`if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The claim function validates the parameters primarily through signature checks and relies on a nonce stored on-chain for replay protection.
2. The blockchain experiences a reorg that rolls back at least one block containing a token claim transaction.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker submits a valid claim transaction (Claim A) with a valid signature and an unused nonce.
2. The transaction is mined in a block that is later invalidated by the reorg.

* Reorg Occurs

4. A reorg replaces the attackerâ€™s claim block with a new canonical chain.
5. The state changes caused by the invalidated block, including the updated nonce, are reverted.

* Replay the Claim:

6. Since the nonce reset and the signature remain valid, the attacker submits Claim A again on the new chain.
7. The contract processes the claim, assuming it is the first instance.




### Impact

The attacker successfully claims tokens twice without detection.

### Mitigation

Introduce nonce validation at the signature level, ensuring the same signature cannot be reused even if the nonce is reset.
