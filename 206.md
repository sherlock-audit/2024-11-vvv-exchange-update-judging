# Stale `exchangeRateNumerator` in VVVVCInvestmentLedger signatures causes loss of funds

# Summary
We know that signatures generated by `VVVVCInvestmentLedger#signer` is valid until the deadline is expired . The `exchangeRateNumerator` in the `InvestParams` struct which is used in `invest` function would be stale if used after some time is passed , to cause loss of funds . 

# Vulnerability Details 
`VVVVCInvestmentLedger#invest` is used to facilitate kyc address's investment in a project . It takes in `InvestParams` struct as the parameter  - 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L60C4-L73C6
```solidity
 struct InvestParams {
        uint256 investmentRound;
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit;
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp;
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp;
        address paymentTokenAddress;
        address kycAddress;
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation;
        uint256 amountToInvest;
        uint256 exchangeRateNumerator;                                        <@
        uint256 feeNumerator;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }
```
later the `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` is used to convert the stablecoin to investment token  here - 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L164C1-L166C37
```solidity
        // the stablecoin amount equivalent to the payment token amount supplied at the current exchange rate
        uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
            exchangeRateDenominator;
```
As time passes , the exchange rate between the investment token and stable coin changes to cause problems . 
## Example Flow of Bug 
Let's assume the investment token is vvv and Stable coin is $DAI here & constant `exchangeRateDenominator` is 1e18
1) `VVVVCInvestmentLedger#signer` signs a signature for kyc address where the `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` is 7e18 , i.e., 
vvv : $DAI = 1: 7 & `_params.amountToInvest` is 1000 Dai = 1000e18 with deadline of 2 minutes for signature .
2) The kyc address calls the invest function after 1 minute , but now the actual exchange rate changed from 7e18 -> 6.8e18 , but signature still has the exchange rate of 7e18 . 
So the `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent ` recorded will be (1000e18 * 7e18) / 1e18 = 7000e18 , instead of 6800e18 , causing loss of funds for protocol . The same can happen otherwise where the loss of funds will be for Users . 
# Impact 
Loss of funds due to stale exchange rate usage . 

# Recommendation 
To mitigate this issue two things can be done - 
1) one to add Protection mechanism by adding `minExchangeRateNumerator` & `maxExchangeRateNumerator` in the `InvestParams ` struct to ensure the exchange rate doesn't go beyond a limit
2) second is Oracle integration to get realtime on-chain prices for final calculations (preferably Chainlink)
