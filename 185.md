# Funds can be stolen from any user by frontrunning their `claim()` transaction.

### Summary

On any chain where frontrunning is possible (e.g., ETH, BNB, AVAX), every user claiming transaction can be frontrun, resulting in stolen funds.

### Root Cause

The `claim()` function does not validate that `msg.sender` matches the `kycAddress` before sending all tokens belonging to `kycAddress` to the function caller. This issue occurs because `msg.sender` is directly used in the `safeTransferFrom()` function ([source](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L133)).

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the mempool and identifies Alice `claim()` transaction.
2. The attacker frontruns Alice transaction using the same `ClaimParams` data that was signed for Alice.
3. The attacker steals all funds belonging to Alice.

### Impact

- Theft of funds belonging to other users.

### Mitigation

Add a validation check for `msg.sender` in the `claim()` function.

```diff
+       if (msg.sender != _params.kycAddress) {
+           revert InvalidClaimer();
+       }
```
