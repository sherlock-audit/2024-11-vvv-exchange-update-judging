# `kycAddressAllocation` and `investmentRoundLimit` can by bypassed with edgeCases

### Summary
Due to allowance of using the signature in `invest` multiple times, there can be edge cases where racing condition, frontrunning, the admin call to `addInvestmentRecords` to bypass the max allocation


### Root Cause
- in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` signature can be used multiple times till its `deadLine`.
- Admin call to `addInvestmentRecords` doesn't check `kycAddressAllocation` and `investmentRoundLimit`

> _*Note!*_: its common since that `addInvestmentRecords` is used to allow users invest off-chain and add their record later after
### Internal pre-conditions
Normal user invest part of his allocation off-chain and part on-chain


### External pre-conditions
Admin using public meme pools to call `addInvestmentRecords`


### Attack Path
**Note!**: None of the following attack paths assume that the central off-chain system misbehave

1. `kycAddressAllocation` is set to 1000
2. User invest 100 via off-chain fiat
   
According to how the off-chain system works, user will need to observe how delayed a call to `addInvestmentRecords` can have, after how many seconds the signer address sign his request(to observe if its automated system or not, (it will mostly be automated))

After knowing the above, there can be multiple attack combinations to reach the needed state.
Lets assume that the signing is automated and will not delay, since we assume that in the audit readMe, and our request will be signed very fast

3. user observe memepool to see admin calling `addInvestmentRecords` to add hism 100 investment
4. user immediately apply for on-chain investment request for a value of 100 (note, the centralized off-chain verification will pass here, since 100 off-chain and 100 on-chain investments still didn't exceed the max allocation of 1000 per address)
5. While we are yet in the same block, user frontrun the admin call and execute an `invest` call 10 times with the same signed request, so that he has 1000 in `kycAddressInvestedPerRound`
6. the admin call gets executed making the `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` to be 1100
   
The above values are for explanatory purposes and can differ and can have larger impact

In the above scenarios i gave an example of how a user can leverage multiple signature usage associated with admin behaving in normal non malicious way of adding the off-chain investment records
### Impact
the `kycAddressAllocation` can be bypassed in edge cases, causing un fair investment participation to other investors and law compliance problems


### Mitigation
2 solutions

1. Put validation on the admin call to `addInvestmentRecords` so that no max limits exceeded
2. disallow double signature usage in `invest` using nonce exactly like `claim` implementation
