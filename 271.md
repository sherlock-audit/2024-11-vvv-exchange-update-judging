# Truncation Risk in Investment Calculations

### Summary

Integer division truncation in Solidity causes a loss of precision during the calculation of stable coin equivalents. This can lead to **miscalculated investment amounts** for investors as the contract calculates `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` and `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` using truncated values.

### Root Cause

In [VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol:165-171]:
- The use of integer division in the following calculations leads to truncation:
  ```solidity
  uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;
  uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
  ```

- Solidity truncates any fractional part in the division, causing a precision loss. This issue propagates to subsequent calculations, potentially misrepresenting investment amounts.

### Internal pre-conditions


1. `_params.amountToInvest` needs to be a small value.
2. `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` and `exchangeRateDenominator` need to have a significant difference in magnitude, amplifying the loss.


### External pre-conditions

1. Investors are allowed to provide small investment amounts.
2. The exchange rate is configured with values that make precision loss more significant (e.g., small `exchangeRateDenominator`).

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Investors may **suffer minor financial losses** due to precision loss in calculations:
- The calculated `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` and `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` may be slightly lower than expected, reducing the represented investment value.
- For small investments, this could cause a significant mismatch between the actual value and the calculated value.

Example:
- With `_params.amountToInvest = 1`, `_params.exchangeRateNumerator = 1000000`, and `exchangeRateDenominator = 3`, the truncation removes `0.33...` from the calculated stablecoin equivalent, propagating an imprecision across further calculations.

### PoC

An example of truncation impact with small values:
```solidity
uint256 amountToInvest = 1;
uint256 exchangeRateNumerator = 1000000;
uint256 exchangeRateDenominator = 3;
uint256 feeNumerator = 200; // 2% fee
uint256 FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10000;

// Expected vs. Actual
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (amountToInvest * exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;
// Expected: 333333.33..., Actual: 333333

uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent -
    (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
// Actual: 326666 (instead of 326666.67)
```


### Mitigation

1. Use **fixed-point arithmetic libraries** like [ABDKMath64x64](https://github.com/abdk-consulting/abdk-libraries-solidity) to handle fractional calculations precisely.
2. Apply rounding mechanisms (e.g., round-up) to reduce underestimation errors in calculations:
   ```solidity
   uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = ((_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) + exchangeRateDenominator - 1) / exchangeRateDenominator;
   ```
