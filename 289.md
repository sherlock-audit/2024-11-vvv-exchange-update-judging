# The parameter _params.amountToInvest (investment amount) is not included in the signed data.

### Summary

In your contract, the InvestParams struct includes the amountToInvest field, which indicates the amount of tokens a user wishes to invest. However, during the signature verification process, amountToInvest is not included in the message covered by the signature. This implies that an attacker could use a legitimate signature but modify amountToInvest to any value, as it is not bound to the signature.

### Root Cause

1.The Type Hash of the Signature Does Not Include amountToInvest:
```solidity
bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH = 
    keccak256(
        bytes(
            "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
        )
    );
```
As shown, INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH does not contain the amountToInvest field.

2 Signature Verification Does Not Include amountToInvest:

In the _isSignatureValid function, the generated digest does not include amountToInvest:
```solidity
function _isSignatureValid(InvestParams memory _params) internal view returns (bool) {
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
            "\x19\x01",
            DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH,
                    _params.investmentRound,
                    _params.investmentRoundLimit,
                    _params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp,
                    _params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp,
                    _params.paymentTokenAddress,
                    _params.kycAddress,
                    _params.kycAddressAllocation,
                    _params.exchangeRateNumerator,
                    _params.feeNumerator,
                    _params.deadline
                )
            )
        )
    );

    address recoveredAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, _params.signature);

    bool isSigner = recoveredAddress == signer;
    bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;
    return isSigner && !isExpired;
}
```
In the abi.encode call, _params.amountToInvest is not encoded.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Lack of Binding Agreement on Amount: Since the amountToInvest isn’t part of the signed data, a user can alter this value arbitrarily when calling the invest function. The signer (presumably an authorized entity or oracle) has no way of specifying or limiting the amount a user can invest because it’s not bound by the signature.
Potential Overinvestment: Users could potentially invest amounts exceeding their authorized limits or allocations, bypassing any controls that the signature was supposed to enforce.
Bypassing Allocation Checks: While the contract does perform checks against kycAddressAllocation and investmentRoundLimit, these are calculated based on postFeeStableAmountEquivalent, which is derived from amountToInvest. If amountToInvest isn’t controlled, these calculations can be manipulated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, you should include amountToInvest in the data that’s hashed and signed. This way, the signer can explicitly agree to a specific investment amount, and any tampering with amountToInvest would result in an invalid signature.
