# Any malicious user/party can claim funds belong to someone else in case of  signature leakage

### Summary

The missing validation of caller in VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol::claim() will lead to loss of funds for a user whose  signature is leaked or exposed somehow (e.g., through insecure off-chain storage or transmission).Anyone can use it to make a claim because the function mechanism does not check that `msg.sender` matches `_params.kycAddress`.

### Root Cause

The [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106) method does not check that the caller (msg.sender) matches _params.kycAddress.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Signature Leakage.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The users whose signatures exposed due to any potential reasons will be under risk of losing their funds. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check that ensures `msg.sender` matches `_params.kycAddress` .
