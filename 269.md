# Admin will bypass investment limits causing unfair allocations for regular investors

### Summary

The lack of maximum allocation checks in `addInvestmentRecords` will cause unfair investment round distributions for regular investors as admin can record investments that exceed round limits which would be rejected in the normal invest() process.

### Root Cause

In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`, the [`addInvestmentRecords`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256C4-L269C51) function 
 lacks the crucial checks present in `invest()`:

```solidity
// invest() has strict checks
@> if (postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound
    || postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound) {
    revert ExceedsAllocation();
}

// But addInvestmentRecords directly adds without checks
kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Investment round limit is set to 1,000 USDC
2. Regular user allocation per KYC address is set to 100 USDC 
3. Current total invested in round is 900 USDC
4. A regular user has already invested 50 USDC


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `addInvestmentRecords` with:
   - `amountsToInvest` = 200 USDC (exceeds both round limit and per-address limit)
   - `kycAddresses` = [address1]
   - `investmentRounds` = [1]
2. The amount is recorded successfully despite exceeding limits
3. When regular users try to invest through `invest()`, their transactions revert due to "ExceedsAllocation"

### Impact

Regular investors cannot participate in the investment round as intended because admin-recorded investments can exceed limits that regular investors must respect. This creates an unfair advantage for off-chain investments and could potentially lock out on-chain investors completely.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

```diff

function addInvestmentRecords(
        address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
        uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
        uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest,
+       uint256 _kycAddressAllocation,   // Single allocation limit for all addresses
+       uint256 _investmentRoundLimit    // Single round limit 
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (_kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length || _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

+           uint256 kycAddressInvestedThisRound = kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound];
+           uint256 totalInvestedThisRound = totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound];

+           if (amountToInvest > _kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
+               amountToInvest > _investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound) {
+               revert ExceedsAllocation();
+           }

            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
        }
    }
