# Lack of Validation in addInvestmentRecords Function Causes Exceeding of Allocation Limits

### Summary


The addInvestmentRecords function allows an authorized user to update investment records without verifying whether the new investment exceeds the kycAddressAllocation or investmentRoundLimit. This lack of validation can result in over-allocations, unlike the invest function, which implements these checks
### Root Cause


The addInvestmentRecords function lacks a check to verify whether the invested amount exceeds the allocation limits, as implemented in the invest function:  

[VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L175-L181](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L175-L181)
```solidity
        // check if kyc address has already invested the max stablecoin-equivalent amount for this round,
        // or if the total invested for this round has reached the limit
        if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An authorized user calls addInvestmentRecords to add an investment amount to a KYC address.
2. The owner of the KYC address front-runs the authorized user's transaction and deposits their full allocation for the round.
3. The authorized user call is then executed, increasing the investment for the KYC address beyond the allowed limit, potentially exceeding the kycAddressAllocation.

### Impact

1. user could result in greater rewards if the KycAddressInvestedThisRound is used to calculate rewards.
2. Once the kycAddressInvestedThisRound exceeds the allowed allocation, there is no mechanism to deduct the excess investment. This could result in the contract being in an inconsistent state
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
 add this check in addInvestmentRecords function.
 
 ```solidity
 if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```
