# Unauthorized users can invest in the contract `VVVVCInvestmentLedger`.

### Summary

A vulnerability in the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contract allows a malicious user to completely bypass KYC controls through signature reuse(they can do this by sharing there signature and letting other unauthoraized users invest on there kyc address). The `invest()` function lacks validation between msg.sender and _params.kycAddress, enabling unauthorized users to invest using signatures meant for KYC-verified addresses. additionally, the function does notvalidate amountToInvest against the signed parameters, allowing multiple investments(from unauthorized users) until the allocation limit is reached.

### Root Cause

IN VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141
     Missing validations: 
     1. require(msg.sender == _params.kycAddress, "Sender must be KYC address");
     plus the amountToInvest is not validated so a malicious user can take advantage of this
    

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Assuming a scenario where
Alice is verified off chain with 
```solidity
    InvestParams memory params = InvestParams({
    investmentRound: 1,
    investmentRoundLimit: 5_000_000,  // Total round limit
    investmentRoundStartTimestamp: currentTime,
    investmentRoundEndTimestamp: currentTime + 7 days,
    paymentTokenAddress: USDT_ADDRESS,
    kycAddress: ALICE_ADDRESS,        // Alice's KYC'd address
    kycAddressAllocation: 1m usdt // Alice's allocation
    exchangeRateNumerator: 1_000_000, // 1e6
    feeNumerator: 200,               // 2% fee
    deadline: currentTime + 1 days,
    signature: ALICE_VALID_SIGNATURE
});
```
### Attack Path

Alice can share her valid signature to Bob, Charlie, and Dave (unauthorized users). Due to missing amount validation, they can all use the same signature repeatedly with different amounts;
Mathematical Breakdown with Exchange Rate:
Assume KYC'd User Alice receives approval for:
Investment Round: 1
KYC Address Allocation: 1,000,000 USDT
Exchange Rate Numerator: 1_000_000 (1e6)
Exchange Rate Denominator: 1_000_000 (1e6)
Fee Numerator: 200 (2% fee)
1)Bob makes multiple investments:
Investment 1: 200,000 USDT
Stable Equivalent = (200,000 * 1_000_000) / 1_000_000 = 200,000
Fee: 200,000 * (200/10000) = 4,000 USDT
Net Investment: 196,000 USDT

Investment 2: 100,000 USDT
Stable Equivalent = (100,000 * 1_000_000) / 1_000_000 = 100,000
Fee: 100,000 * (200/10000) = 2,000 USDT
Net Investment: 98,000 USDT
2)Charlie makes multiple investments:
  Investment 1: 150,000 USDT
Stable Equivalent = (150,000 * 1_000_000) / 1_000_000 = 150,000
Fee: 150,000 * (200/10000) = 3,000 USDT
Net Investment: 147,000 USDT

Investment 2: 200,000 USDT
Stable Equivalent = (200,000 * 1_000_000) / 1_000_000 = 200,000
Fee: 200,000 * (200/10000) = 4,000 USDT
Net Investment: 196,000 USDT
3) Dave makes multiple investmnts:

CopyInvestment 1: 250,000 USDT
Stable Equivalent = (250,000 * 1_000_000) / 1_000_000 = 250,000
Fee: 250,000 * (200/10000) = 5,000 USDT
Net Investment: 245,000 USDT

Investment 2: 100,000 USDT
Stable Equivalent = (100,000 * 1_000_000) / 1_000_000 = 100,000
Fee: 100,000 * (200/10000) = 2,000 USDT
Net Investment: 98,000 USDT
Total unauthorized investments using Alice's signature:
Total Invest: 1,000,000 USDT (Hit allocation limit)
Total Fee: 20,000 USDT (2% of gross)
Total Net: 980,000 USDT`
###  Impact
 1) Allows unauthorized users to participate in private investment rounds
 2) Enables multiple investments using the same signature until allocation limit is reached(although this is a design choice but 
     this design choice actually hurts the protocol as the malicious users can use this to there advantage)
 3) Breaks KYC tracking as multiple investments from different sources appear as one KYC'd user
 4) Creates regulatory compliance risks as unverified users can invest(people who might not get selected off chain to invest in 
     the protocol for any reason can now invest)- 
     From README:
"A trusted off-chain centralized system handles creating the signatures which validate calls to VVVVCInvestmentLedger:invest()"-
 A)Three unauthorized users (Bob, Charlie, Dave) invested 1M USDT total through multiple transactions
 B)All investments are recorded under Alice's KYC address
 C)The centralized system loses ability to track actual investment sources(as all goes under alice`s name)
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add msg.sender validation in the invest() function:
```solidity
function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
    require(msg.sender == _params.kycAddress, "Sender must be KYC address");
    //  rest of the function
}
```
