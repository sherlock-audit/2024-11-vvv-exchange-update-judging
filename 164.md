# Investors can bypass their allocation cap by front-running the admin function `addInvestmentRecords()`.

### Summary

The `addInvestmentRecords()` function lacks checks on the invested amount for each investor. Users who already have a signature to invest can front-run this admin function. If they reach their allocation cap before the admin action, their invested amount will exceed the cap after the admin action.

### Root Cause

The [addInvestmentRecords()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256-L277) function only increases the invested amounts for users and does not check their investment amount cap.

```solidity
    function addInvestmentRecords(
        address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
        uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
        uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (
            _kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length ||
            _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length
        ) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
        }
    }
```

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. Alice has a signature with an allocation cap of 1000 in a specific round.
2. The admin calls the `addInvestmentRecords()` function to increase Alice's investment amount to 500.
3. Alice front-runs the admin action and invests 1000.

Finally, after the admin action is performed, Alice's investment amount increases to 1500, exceeding her allocation cap.

### Impact

Users can bypass their allocation cap by front-running the admin function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to incorporate allocation checks in the `addInvestmentRecords()` function.
