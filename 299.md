# KYC Address Allocation Not Properly Enforced in invest() Function

### Summary

The invest() function allows an address other than the kycAddress to make investments, which could lead to [unauthorized investments] for [users] as [attackers] can [bypass KYC restrictions by calling the invest() function with a different address].

### Root Cause

In the current implementation, the caller of the invest() function does not need to be the same as the kycAddress, allowing unauthorized individuals to make investments on behalf of other users. This bypasses the KYC check, which is intended to prevent such actions.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `invest()` function allows any address to call the function, regardless of whether it matches the `kycAddress`.
2. There is no explicit validation to ensure that the address calling the function matches the associated `kycAddress`.

### External pre-conditions

- No external conditions specifically impact this issue directly. The problem lies in the internal implementation and the lack of address validation.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the `invest()` function with an address different from the `kycAddress`.
2. The protocol does not validate the caller’s address against the `kycAddress`, allowing the attacker to bypass the KYC restriction.
3. This results in unauthorized investments being made on behalf of another user, potentially leading to fraud or manipulation.

### Impact

The users suffer from unauthorized investments being made on their behalf, potentially causing financial losses or manipulation of their investment accounts. The protocol suffers from a breach in KYC requirements, undermining its integrity.

### PoC

```solidity
// Example of bypassing KYC check by using a different address
address attacker = 0x1234...; // Attacker's address
address kycAddress = 0xSomeValidAddress; // The valid KYC address
uint256 amountToInvest = 1000;

// Attacker calls invest with different address
contract.invest({
    amountToInvest: amountToInvest,
    exchangeRateNumerator: 1,
    kycAddress: kycAddress,
    feeNumerator: 50
});
```

### Mitigation

- Add a check in the `invest()` function to ensure that the caller’s address is the same as the `kycAddress` to prevent unauthorized investments.
- Ensure that only the KYC-approved address can initiate investment transactions.
