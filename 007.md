# User can avoid paying fees by splitting their investment into multiple small ones

### Summary
Upon each individual investment, the user is charged fees which are rounded down

```solidity
        // the post-fee stableAmountEquivalent, to contribute toward user and round limits
        uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent -
            (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) /
            FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```

As the fees are rounded down and the protocol is intended to be deployed on L2s such as Base where gas costs are irrelevant, users have an incentive to split their investment into multiple txs in order to avoid fees. This becomes especially true when payment tokens such as WBTC/ USDT are used.

At current Base gas costs of 0.01 gwei and WBTC price of $100k, the transaction gas costs are pretty much the same as the 0.9999 wei rounded down per transaction ($0.001). Currently the attack is not profitable for the user, but is more of a griefing vector to the protocol. Given a change in price in WBTC and in gas costs, attack can soon also become profitable for the user.


### Root Cause
Rounding down.

### Attack Path
1. User is allowed to invest $1000 of WBTC (at price $100k) in the protocol at 1 bps fee.
2. Instead of depositing ~$1000.1 of WBTC to cover for the platform fee, the user decides to split the transaction in 101 smaller ones, such that in each one the platform fee is rounded down.
3. In the end the user deposits only $1000 of WBTC and avoid paying fees whatsoever 

The relative loss for the protocol is 100% of their expected fees from said user

### Impact
Loss of fees for the protocol
