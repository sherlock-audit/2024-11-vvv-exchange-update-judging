# A max round and max user allocations can be unintentionally exceeded

### Summary

Due to a missing check in `addInvestmentRecords` max allocations can be exceeded preventing further investments. 

### Root Cause

A protocol admin can make Investment Records without transfering tokens to the contract. 
There are two important variables that check the maximum possible investment allocation for the specific round or user. These variables are checked during the [regular call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L175):

```solidity
        // check if kyc address has already invested the max stablecoin-equivalent amount for this round,
        // or if the total invested for this round has reached the limit
        if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```

, however missing in [record modification](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256):

```solidity
    function addInvestmentRecords(
        address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
        uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
        uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (
            _kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length ||
            _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length
        ) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
        }
    }
```

So max allocation ammounts can be unintentionally exceeded and no other investemnts will be possible.

Max allocation ammounts can be unintentionally exceeded and no other investemnts will be possible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider providing the same allocation amount check as it presents in the invest() function.
