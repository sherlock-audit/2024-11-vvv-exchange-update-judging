# Incorrectly adding the investment address and amount

### Summary

During the process where the administrator adds multiple investment records to the contract, a condition was missed, which allowed bypassing the check for matching investment addresses and amounts, leading to the creation of incorrect investment records.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability code is as follows:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L261-L266
We can see that the if condition only checks if the lengths of the investment address array and the investment round array are equal, and compares the length of the investment amount array with the investment round array. It overlooks the comparison between the lengths of the investment address array and the investment amount array. This is a careless oversight.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Due to the uncertainty about whether the lengths of the investment address array and the investment amount array are equal, this can lead to the administrator recording incorrect investment information, causing mismatched investment amounts and rounds for users. If an attacker exploits this vulnerability, they could enter an investment round as a low-investment participant and manipulate the number of investment addresses, resulting in a mismatch between the length of the investment amount array and the address array. This could cause the administrator to record a higher investment amount, leading to irreversible losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a validation check to ensure that the lengths of the investment address array and the investment amount array are equal, as shown below:
```solidity
if (
         _kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length ||
         _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length ||
            _kycAddresses.length !=_amountsToInvest.length
        ) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }
```
