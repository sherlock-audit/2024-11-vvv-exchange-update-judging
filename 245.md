# Encoding of data is not done correctly according to EIP712

### Summary

`VVVVCTokenDistributor::_isSignatureValid` incorrectly encodes some of the params which will lead wrong hash and therefore the verification process will not work as expected and will fail. `ClaimParams` contains 2 array variables that according to EIP712 should be hashed by a specific way.

### Root Cause

In [`VVVVCTokenDistributor::_isSignatureValid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L167-L168) we can see how the `digest` is constructed which is by hashing `"\x19\x01"` with the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` and the hashed struct. The struct in our case is the `ClaimParams` that contains 2 array variables - `address[] projectTokenProxyWallets` and `uint256[] tokenAmountsToClaim`. According to EIP712(which is specifically mentioned in the ReadMe) arrays should be handled differently:

> The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents (i.e. the encoding of SomeType[5] is identical to that of a struct containing five members of type SomeType).

You can read more [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712).

However the `digest` constructed in `_isSignaturValid` doesn't do that:

```solidity
bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenAddress,
->                        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
->                        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
                        _params.nonce,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
                )
            )
        );
```

This will result in the improper functioning of the function

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Any signature might fail due to the difference in hashing

### Impact

Signature verification doesn't work as expected by EIP712

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the `keccak256` hash of the concatenated encodeData of both `_params.projectTokenProxyWallets` and `_params.tokenAmountsToClaim`.
