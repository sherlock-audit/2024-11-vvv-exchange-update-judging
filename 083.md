# [M-01] Protocol is not `EIP712` compliant: incorrect typehash for `InvestParam` structures

**Vulnerability Details**
When implementing `EIP712`, among other things, for data structures that will be a part of signing message, a typehash must be defined.

The structure [typehash is defined as](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-hashstruct): `typeHash = keccak256(encodeType(typeOf(s)))`

Where `encodeType` is the type of a struct that is encoded as: `name ‖ "(" ‖ member₁ ‖ "," ‖ member₂ ‖ "," ‖ … ‖ memberₙ ")" `

And each member is written as: `type ‖ " " ‖ name`.

The project uses the structure on the signed data `InvestParam`

```javascript
 /**
     * @notice Struct for investment parameters
     * @param investmentRound The round of the investment
     * @param investmentRoundLimit The limit of the investment round
     * @param investmentRoundStartTimestamp The start timestamp of the investment round
     * @param investmentRoundEndTimestamp The end timestamp of the investment round
     * @param paymentTokenAddress The address of the payment token
     * @param kycAddress The address of the kyc address
     * @param kycAddressAllocation The max amount the kyc address can invest
     * @param amountToInvest The amount of paymentToken to invest
     * @param exchangeRateNumerator The numerator of the conversion of payment token to stablecoin (i.e. VVV to USDC)
     * @param feeNumerator The numerator of the fee subtracted from the investment stable-equivalent amount
     * @param deadline The deadline for the investment
     * @param signature The signature of the investment
     */
    struct InvestParams {
        uint256 investmentRound;
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit;
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp;
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp;
        address paymentTokenAddress;
        address kycAddress;
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation;
@>  uint256 amountToInvest;
        uint256 exchangeRateNumerator;
        uint256 feeNumerator;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }
```
**However, the precalculated typehash for the structure is of different structure**:

 For `InvestParam` the hash is actually calculated
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L19C2-L24C11
```javascript
 bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
        bytes(
            "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
        )
    );
```

**Impact**
Protocol is not EIP712 compliant, which will result in issues with integrators.

**Tool Used**
An [online keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) checker for validating that the those hashes are not actually for the correct structures.

**Recommendation**
Modify the structure typehash (and tests) to point to the correct structures.
