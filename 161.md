# Immutable Domain Separator Breaks EIP-712 Composability on Chain Forks

### Summary

The contract relies on an immutable domain separator for EIP-712 message signing and verification. While this approach optimizes gas usage, it introduces a  flaw: the domain separator cannot be updated dynamically in the event of a blockchain fork where the chainId changes.

### Impact

EIP-712 mandates that the domain separator uniquely identifies the signing context by incorporating the chainId, contract address, and domain name. If the chainId changes due to a fork, the immutable domain separator becomes invalid, leading to the following issues:

Message Invalidity: Any previously signed messages can no longer be verified, as the domain separator is tied to the pre-fork chainId.
Loss of Composability: EIP-712 messages lose their reliability across the ecosystem, undermining interoperability with other contracts or systems.

### Mitigation

Introduce Dynamic Domain Separator Logic like that used in openzeppelin eip712 logic
