# Precision Loss in invest() Function Causes Excess Fee Payment and Reduced User Stake

### Summary

The invest() function suffers from a precision loss issue caused by performing division before multiplication when calculating the postFeeStableAmountEquivalent. This leads to an incorrect computation of the fee amount, causing users to pay extra fees. As a result, users' actual stake is reduced due to the imprecise calculations.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the order of operations in the calculation of postFeeStableAmountEquivalent. In Solidity, performing division before multiplication on uint256 values can lead to precision loss because Solidity truncates decimals during division. Specifically, the issue arises in this calculation:

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;

uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - 
    (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```

Here, the division is performed first when calculating postFeeStableAmountEquivalent, resulting in precision loss.
