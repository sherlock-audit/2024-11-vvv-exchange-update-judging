# Missing Validation in `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` function can drain the ProjectTokenProxyWallets.

### Summary

the param `tokenAmountsToClaim` submitted by user while calling `claim` function is not validated before transferring the said amount to user from `projectTokenProxyWallet`. This lack of validation can be exploited by user by setting it to a higher number( more than what they are qualified to get). 

### Root Cause

In `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol:106`, there is no validation for param `tokenAmountsToClaim`. In line 131, said amount is directly transferred to msg.sender. this lack of check can be exploited by user to  steal funds from projectTokenProxyWallet.

```Solidity
// transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
  @--->              _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```
