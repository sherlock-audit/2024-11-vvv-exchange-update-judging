# Front-Running Vulnerability in VVVVCTokenDistributor Claim Function

### Summary

Sending claimed tokens to msg.sender instead of a known KYC address or a signature verified address will cause a direct token theft risk for legitimate users as attackers can front-run claim transactions to steal tokens by copying valid signatures from the mempool. 

### Root Cause

In VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L133, the token transfer sends to msg.sender instead of the authorized KYC address or an address included in the signature:
```solidity
projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
    _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
    msg.sender,  // <-- Root cause: should send to _params.kycAddress
    _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors mempool for valid claim transactions
2. When a valid claim transaction is seen:
a. Attacker copies the exact ClaimParams and signature
 b. Attacker submits the same transaction with higher gas price
5. Attacker's transaction gets mined first due to higher gas
6. Tokens are sent to attacker's address (msg.sender) instead of intended KYC address
7. Original user's transaction fails due to used nonce

### Impact

The legitimate KYC-verified user suffers a complete loss of their claimable tokens. The attacker gains all tokens that were meant for the legitimate user.
