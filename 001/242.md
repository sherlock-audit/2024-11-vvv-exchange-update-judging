# In function claim it is possible to frontrun KYC address to get his funds

### Summary

In the claim function of the VVVVCTokenDistributor contract https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106-L145
The msg.sender is not validated to ensure it matches the kycAddress from the ClaimParams. This oversight allows a front-running attack where an attacker can steal funds by intercepting a legitimate claim attempt and calling the function with the same parameters.

### Root Cause

The claim function directly sends tokens to msg.sender without verifying if msg.sender is the KYC address specified in the ClaimParams. This enables anyone to front-run the transaction and steal funds intended for the rightful KYC address.

### Internal pre-conditions

The _isSignatureValid function validates the signature and ensures it was created by the designated signer.
The _params.nonce is greater than the current stored nonce for the _params.kycAddress.
The arrays _params.projectTokenProxyWallets and _params.tokenAmountsToClaim have matching lengths.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker observes a valid ClaimParams struct signed by the authorized signer (e.g., via a public mempool).
The contract allows any caller to execute the claim function.

### Attack Path

A user with a valid ClaimParams struct prepares a transaction to call the claim function.
The attacker intercepts this transaction and extracts the ClaimParams struct from the public mempool.
The attacker submits their transaction with the same ClaimParams but with their own address as msg.sender.
Since msg.sender is not validated against _params.kycAddress, the contract allows the transfer, sending the funds to the attacker.

### Impact

The attack results in:

Loss of tokens for the rightful KYC address.
Breach of trust in the system and potential legal liabilities for the project.

### PoC

A valid ClaimParams struct:

```solidity
ClaimParams memory params = ClaimParams({
    kycAddress: 0xKYCAddress,
    projectTokenAddress: 0xTokenAddress,
    projectTokenProxyWallets: [0xWallet1, 0xWallet2],
    tokenAmountsToClaim: [1000, 2000],
    nonce: 1,
    deadline: block.timestamp + 3600,
    signature: validSignature
});
```
Victim submits:

```solidity
distributor.claim(params);
```
Attacker intercepts and submits:

```solidity
distributor.claim(params);
```
Tokens are transferred to the attacker instead of the victim.

### Mitigation

In the claim function the msg.sender is not checked if it is a KYC address, Becuase of that a frontrun attack on the msg.sender is possible and loss of funds can occur.
```diff
+  require(msg.sender == _params.kycAddress, "Sender must be the KYC address");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,   
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
```
