# Malicious actors can front-run and steal token from users.

### Summary

In the `claim` function, there are no checks for the caller, and the caller is not included in the signature. However, the tokens are ultimately sent to the caller's wallet. This allows malicious actors to front-run on blockchains, like Ethereum, where the mempool is visible, and steal tokens that are allocated to the `kycAddress`.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L133
The claim function does not perform any checks on the caller, yet the tokens are ultimately assigned to the caller's address. 

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls the claim function to claim tokens, and the transaction enters the mempool.
2. A malicious actor copies the user's transaction from the mempool and do front-run.
4. The malicious actor successfully claims the tokens and receives them, while the user's transaction is reverted, as the tokens have already been claimed by the attacker.

### Impact

Malicious can steal tokens that are allocated to the `kycAddress`.

### Mitigation

```diff
        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
-               msg.sender,
+               _params.kycAddress,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```
Or include the caller's address in the signature information
