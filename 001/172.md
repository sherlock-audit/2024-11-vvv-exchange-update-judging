# Malicious actors will steal tokens from KYC users through front-running

### Summary

Missing validation between `msg.sender` and `kycAddress` in `claim()` will cause a complete loss of claimed tokens for  KYC users as malicious actors will front-run claim transactions using valid signatures meant for legitimate users

### Root Cause

**In [`contracts/vc//VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L130-134`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L130-134) there is a critical validation missing as tokens are transferred to `msg.sender` instead of the signature-verified `params.kycAddress`**


### Internal pre-conditions

1. claimIsPaused needs to be false to allow claim transactions
2. Project token proxy wallets need to have approved the VVVVCTokenDistributor contract for token transfers
3. Valid signature from authorized signer must exist for a KYC address's claim

### External pre-conditions

1. Mempool needs to be publicly accessible for transaction monitoring
2. Gas price needs to be flexible to allow transaction reordering

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors mempool for claim transactions using bots or other tools.
2. Kyc user broadcasts claim transaction with valid signature and parameters:
3. Attackers detects transaction and copies exact parameters
4. Attacker submits identical transaction with higher gas price
5. Attacker's transaction gets mined first, stealing the tokens
6. Original user's transaction succeeds but tokens are already taken

### Impact

The legitimate KYC user suffers a complete loss of their claimable tokens. The attacker gains 100% of the tokens meant for the legitimate user. The attack can be repeated for each claim until the nonce is consumed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add validation to ensure only the KYC-verified address can claim their tokens:

```solidity
function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
    if (msg.sender != _params.kycAddress) {
        revert UnauthorizedClaimer();
    }

//.... rest of the codes 
}
```

Alternatively - send token directly to KYC Address instead of msg.sender so no matter who calls the claim function the money ends up in the legitimate KYC Address 

```solidity
projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
    _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
    _params.kycAddress,  // Send to KYC address instead of caller
    _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
);
```
