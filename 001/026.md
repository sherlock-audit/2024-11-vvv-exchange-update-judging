# An attacker could front-run user's claim and steal their tokens

### Summary

In the `claim` function in `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` we can see that the signature specifies a `kycAddress` which is the address of the user's KYC wallet. However the tokens to be claimed are actually sent to the msg.sender making this transaction vulnerable to front-running attacks.

### Root Cause

Here the kycAddress is verified:

However the tokens are sent to the msg.sender:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L133

This means as long as the attacker sees the input of the function they will be able to steal the tokens for the claim because they will be the msg.sender 
### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

Should be on chains with public mempool.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls claims with a valid signature.
2. An attacker sees the user's transaction in the public mempool and copies its input, passing more gas so it will be first to execute.
3. Due to the msg.sender being passed here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L133
The tokens to be claimed will be sent to the attacker(because he is the msg.sender) instead of the kycAddress. Also because of the nature of some blockchains and the publicity of the mempools anyone will be able to steal the input(which includes the signature) and claim the tokens for themselves

### Impact

In case of the forementioned attack path the user will lose all the funds from the signed claim transaction to the attacker - High.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Replace `msg.sender` with `kycAddress` so that such front-running attacks are not profitable
