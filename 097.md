# `VVVVCTokenDistributor` is not fully compatible with EIP-712 due to incorrect array encoding

### Summary

Letâ€™s note that [CLAIM_TYPEHASH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L19) uses two arrays 
address[] projectTokenProxyWallets, uint256[] tokenAmountsToClaim.

When validating a signature, these values are encoded as follows.
```solidity
bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets, //@audit this
                        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim, //@audit this
                        _params.nonce,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
                )
            )
        );
```

Now let's look at the [EIP-712 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and how it specifies to handle arrays.

>The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents (i.e. the encoding of SomeType[5] is identical to that of a struct containing five members of type SomeType).

It can be seen that the protocol incorrectly handles signature validation arrays, and therefore does not conform to the EIP-712 standard, which will cause signatures generated using libraries that conform to the standard to be invalid.


### Root Cause

The code does not handle arrya correctly when creating a digest. It simply inserts arrays into abi.encode as if they were atomic types, but this is incorrect. Let's look at how EIP-712 spec requires non atomic type to be handled.

Link to this part of [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) - `Definition of encodeData`

1)Dynamic Values 
> The dynamic values bytes and string are encoded as a keccak256 hash of their contents.

2) Array Values
> The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents



### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

There is no specific attack path, any library that creates signatures according to the EIP-712 specification will not pass validation in the contract due to incorrect validation.

### Impact

2 impacts

1. due to wrong type hash computation leading to wrong digest validation in the signature validator, the signatures might fail.
2. breaking the EIP712 mentioned in `readme` where it strictly complains. The array types should not be used as atomic types


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Hash both of the arrays like this
```solidity
function hashArray(uint256[] memory array) internal returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32[] memory hashedElements;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            hashedElements[i] = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(array[i]));
        }

        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hashedElements));
    }
```
