**Vulnerability Details**
Using Solidity version 0.8.20+ introduces the PUSH0 opcode, but its support is inconsistent across different blockchains. As of now, the deployment status is as follows:

Arbitrum: ❌ No support for PUSH0
BNB Chain: ❌ No support for PUSH0
Avalanche: ❌ No support for PUSH0
Ethereum: ✅ PUSH0 is supported
Base: ✅ PUSH0 is supported
This lack of uniform support could lead to compatibility issues when deploying across different chains.
**Impact**
- Failed deployments on multiple major chains
- Wasted gas fees
- Broken cross-chain functionality
- Project deployment delays

**Mitigation Recommended**
1. Primary Solution:
```diff
    # foundry.toml
    [profile.default]
    src = 'contracts'
    out = 'out'
    libs = ['node_modules', 'lib']
    test = 'test'
    cache_path  = 'cache_forge'
-   solc_version = '0.8.23'
+   solc_version = '0.8.19' # Downgraded from 0.8.23 for cross-chain compatibility
+   evm_version = 'paris'  # Prevents PUSH0 opcode usage
    runs = 2000
    auto_detect_remappings = false
```
