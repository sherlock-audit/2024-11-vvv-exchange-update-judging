# H-2: incorrect exchangeRateDenominator Usage Allows Exploitation via Decimal Mismatch

### Summary

The failure to validate token decimals against the fixed `exchangeRateDenominator` set during contract deployment leads to miscalculations in stablecoin equivalent investments. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit mismatched decimal values, either inflating their contributions or bypassing allocation and fee constraints.

### Root Cause

In VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol:L165-166, the function invest calculates the stablecoin equivalent using:
```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;
```
This assumes the decimals of `_params.paymentTokenAddress` align with the `exchangeRateDenominator` set during contract deployment. However, the protocol does not enforce this alignment, leading to errors when token decimals differ.

### Internal pre-conditions

1- The constructor sets a fixed `exchangeRateDenominator` specific to the round's stablecoin (e.g., USDC = 10e6)
2- `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` is approved off-chain for the round but does not account for token decimal mismatches.
3- Tokens with varying decimals can interact with the invest function (e.g., USDC, USDT, WETH, VVV).

### External pre-conditions

1- An attacker submits a valid investment request signed off-chain, investing tokens with decimals that differ from the round's `exchangeRateDenominator`.
2- The protocol relies on a generic calculation without normalization to a standard decimal scale.

### Attack Path

1- The attacker chooses a token with a mismatched decimal scale relative to `exchangeRateDenominator`.
Example: `exchangeRateDenominator` = 10^6 (for USDC).
2- The attacker invests a token with higher decimals (e.g., WETH with 18 decimals) or lower decimals (e.g., a token with 4 decimals).
3- The invest function calculates the stablecoin equivalent incorrectly:
Inflated Equivalent:
`Token decimals > exchangeRateDenominator.`
-The attacker bypasses allocation limits and fees.
Understated Equivalent:
`Token decimals < exchangeRateDenominator.`
-The attacker pays negligible fees and secures undue allocations.
4- The protocol updates state variables `kycAddressInvestedPerRound`, `totalInvestedPerRound` based on these incorrect values, breaking allocation fairness.


### Impact

# Affected Party: 
The protocol and its investors.
-Inflated Investments:
An attacker monopolizes the round by overstating their contributions.
-Understated Fees:
An attacker avoids paying fees by reducing the calculated stablecoin equivalent.
# Allocation Disruption:
The protocol misallocates resources due to skewed state tracking.
# Severity: High. 
This issue undermines allocation fairness and allows malicious investors to exploit the system at the expense of legitimate participants.

### PoC

1- Deploy the contract with `exchangeRateDenominator` = 10^6 (USDC-based round).
2- Submit an investment using a token with 18 decimals :
```solidity
InvestParams memory params = InvestParams({
    investmentRound: 1,
    investmentRoundLimit: 1_000_000,
    investmentRoundStartTimestamp: block.timestamp,
    investmentRoundEndTimestamp: block.timestamp + 1 hours,
    paymentTokenAddress: 0xWETHTokenAddress,
    kycAddress: 0xAttackerAddress,
    kycAddressAllocation: 500_000,
    amountToInvest: 1 * 10**18, // 1 WETH
    exchangeRateNumerator: 1,
    feeNumerator: 10,
    deadline: block.timestamp + 1 hours,
    signature: validSignature
});
```
3- Observe that the stablecoin equivalent is inflated:
```solidity
// Calculation in the contract:
preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (1e18 * 1) / 1e6 = 1e12;
```
4- The protocol records 1e12 stablecoins as the investment, bypassing allocation checks and state integrity.

### Mitigation

1- Restrict Tokens Per Round:
Enforce a single token type for each investment round: 
```solidity
require(
    _params.paymentTokenAddress == ROUND_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    "Invalid token for this round"
);
```
