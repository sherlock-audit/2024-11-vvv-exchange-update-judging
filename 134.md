# Concurrent claims will block other authorized claim attempts due to nonce management conflict

### Summary

The function `claim` manages a single `nonce` value for each `kycAddress`, which can lead to blocking issues when multiple addresses (aliases) attempt to claim tokens concurrently. Since the `nonce` is incremented for every signature generation, and the first successful claim updates the `nonce` stored in the contract, all other claims using lower `nonce` values will be rejected. This behavior causes conflicts and prevents other authorized addresses from completing their claims.

### Root Cause

- The contract manages a single `nonce` value for a given `kycAddress`, and every claim attempt increments this `nonce` during signature generation.
- The first successful claim updates the `nonce` in the contract, causing all subsequent claims with lower `nonce` values to fail.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Multiple addresses are allowed to claim tokens using valid signatures for the same `kycAddress`.
- Each address generates a `ClaimParams` struct with an incrementing `nonce` value.
- One of the claim attempts is processed successfully, updating the contract's `nonce`.

### External pre-conditions

- Multiple signatures are generated concurrently for the same `kycAddress` with incrementing `nonce` values.
- At least one claim is submitted and successfully updates the `nonce` in the contract.

### Attack Path

1. Multiple authorized addresses generate valid `ClaimParams` with incrementing `nonce` values for the same `kycAddress`.
2. The last generated claim, which has the highest `nonce`, is processed first due to factors such as providing the highest gas, giving it priority over the other claims.
3. Any other claims with a lower `nonce` value for the same `kycAddress` are rejected due to the `if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress])` check.


### Impact

This issue breaks the core functionality of the contract, rendering it effectively useless for claims. Authorized users who rely on claiming tokens via multiple aliases associated with the same `kycAddress` are unable to execute their claims, leading to a loss of core functionality. The contract becomes non-operational for the intended use case of token claims.

### PoC

1. Set up multiple addresses that are valid aliases for a given `kycAddress`.
2. Generate valid signatures and `ClaimParams` structs with incrementing `nonce` values.
3. Submit claims from different addresses concurrently.
4. Observe that the claim with the highest `nonce` (the last generated) is processed first, while all other claims with lower `nonce` values are rejected due to a `nonce` conflict.

### Mitigation

Introduce individual `nonce` management for each authorized alias of a `kycAddress`. This would allow each alias to have its own `nonce` tracking, preventing conflicts when multiple addresses claim tokens concurrently.
