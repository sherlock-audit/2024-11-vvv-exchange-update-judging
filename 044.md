# Lack of Function to Update `signer` Address in Case It Is Compromised

## Description  

in `VVVVCTokenDistributor` and `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contracts, there's no Function For Admin To Update `signer` address in case if it gets Compromised. this will lead to two things:

1. The VVV team will be unable to set a new replacement for the compromised `signer` and will be forced to deploy new `VVVVCTokenDistributor` and `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contracts.
2. Attacker Can Use `signer` private key to sign [ClaimParams](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L36-L54) containing valid values, which will enable him to drain tokens stored in [projectTokenProxyWallets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L49) by calling [VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L102-L145) function. However, this attack is only feasible if:
   
   - The approvals granted to the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contract have not been revoked.
   - The admin has not paused the claiming functionality of the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contract.

## Impact  

- **Damage:** High
- **Likelihood:** Low/Medium (recently, many private keys have been compromised in the Web3 space)
  
**Impact Details:** attacker will be able to drain tokens from `projectTokenProxyWallets` by calling the `claim()` function with a valid signature and parameters. Additionally, the VVV team will be forced to deploy new `VVVVCTokenDistributor` and `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contracts.

## Proof of Concept  

**Attack Path:**

1. attacker finds the private key associated to `signer` in VVVâ€™s servers (e.g., due to poor security practices or OpSec flaws).
2. Using the compromised private key, attacker signs `ClaimParams` struct containing valid values, which will enable him to call `claim()` function to drain tokens from `projectTokenProxyWallets`.

**POC:**

- Not Needed.

## Recommended Mitigation  

Implement the following function in both the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` and `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contracts to enable the admin to update the `signer` address if it gets compromised:

```diff
+   function setSigner(address _signer) external onlyAuthorized {
+       signer = _signer;
+   }
```

also Refactor the `claim()` function implementation to allow users to claim tokens from a single `projectTokenProxyWallet` at a time. Additionally, introduce a delay mechanism between successive calls to the `claim()` function. This would mitigate the risk of an attacker repeatedly calling the function to drain all `projectTokenProxyWallets` and hopefully VVV Incident Response team will be able to detect it and act before that happens.
