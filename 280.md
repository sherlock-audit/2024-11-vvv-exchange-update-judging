# user tokens can be claimed by anyone

### Summary

while a user submits the `claimParams` the tokens are sent to the caller of the function, which is anyone that can see the transaction in the mempool and frontrun the actual owner.

### Root Cause

This is the entire claim function with insufficient validation

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. user calls the `claim` function with valid claim params signed offchain by the `signer`.
2. any other user can see this claim in the mempool and submit it to withdraw all the user tokens due to lack of validation

### Impact

Loss of investment returns for the user

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add validation to ensure that the claim is for the kycAddress that invested in the first place.
