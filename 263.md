# Attacker can block invest function

### Summary

The invest function of VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol does not include the amount invested into the signature.
This means anyone can front run the transaction with a zero wei amount, causing the signature to be used and the following "real" transaction to revert. 

On layer2 the transaction costs are cheap, so a small amount of money can be used to DOS the system and drain gas tokens.

### Root Cause

The signature does not include: `_params.amountToInvest`.
```solidity
abi.encode(
                        INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.investmentRound,
                        _params.investmentRoundLimit,
                        _params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp,
                        _params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp,
                        _params.paymentTokenAddress,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.kycAddressAllocation,
                        _params.exchangeRateNumerator,
                        _params.feeNumerator,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
```

This will lead to the attack described in summery.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Investment round Starts
2. There is a lot of completion, VCs race to get a spot in the round
3. Someone starts DOS for certain VCs to disallow them to invest 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attacker can view transaction in mempool, and call the invest function with _params.amountToInvest = 0 (or 1).

### Impact

DOS and Gas Loss

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include the amount in the signature.
