# Inconsistent Token Decimal Handling Causes Allocation Issues in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol::invest` Function

### Summary

The inconsistent handling of token decimals in the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol::invest` function will cause allocation discrepancies for investors as users will either be prevented from investing or allowed to over-invest depending on the token decimals used. This occurs when different tokens with different decimal places are used in the same investment round, especially if the first token has more decimals than the second and are treated uniformly in investment allocation checks, leading to an incorrect calculation of allocation.


### Root Cause

In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`, the `invest` function performs allocation checks (`kycAddressInvestedThisRound` and `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`) without considering the different token decimals. The root cause is that the condition checking the already invested amount against the current allocation does not normalize the decimals between different tokens. This discrepancy arises when different tokens with varying decimals are used in the same investment round, particularly when the first token has more decimals than the second, resulting in either over-investment or improper rejection.


lets say user have already invested an amount in a round as `kycAddressInvestedThisRound`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol?plain=1#L159
```javascript
uint256 kycAddressInvestedThisRound = kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.kycAddress][_params.investmentRound];
```

Now if a user wants to invest another token that has fewer decimals than the previously invested tokens, it should pass this condition:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol?plain=1#L175-L180

```javascript
if (
    postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
    postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
) {
    revert ExceedsAllocation();
}
```

If `_params.kycAddressAllocation` is too small (but reasonable for the second token's decimals), because `kycAddressInvestedThisRound` is much larger, it reverts with `ExceedsAllocation` (more accurately, it causes an overflow which leads to a revert anyway). On the other hand, if `_params.kycAddressAllocation` is set too high to prevent a revert, then the user can use the same signature to reinvest multiple times. In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`, the invest function performs allocation checks (`kycAddressInvestedThisRound` and `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`) without normalizing token amounts to a consistent decimal format. The root cause is that the allocation check does not account for the differences in token decimals, leading to inaccurate comparisons between already invested amounts and current allocations. This discrepancy arises when different tokens with varying decimals are used in the same investment round, particularly when the first token has more decimals than the second, resulting in either over-investment or improper rejection.




### Internal pre-conditions

- User has invested in one token with more decimals (e.g. 18 decimals) in an investment round, increasing the `kycAddressInvestedThisRound` variable.
- User attempts to invest in a second token with less decimals (e.g. 6 decimals) in the same investment round.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User invests using a token with 18 decimals (e.g., DAI), causing `kycAddressInvestedThisRound` to increase significantly.

2. User then tries to invest using a token with 6 decimals in same round (e.g., USDT).

3. The allocation check compares the `kycAddressInvestedThisRound` (in 18 decimals) to the new token's investment amount (in 6 decimals), which results in either an incorrect rejection or allowing the user to over-invest beyond their allocation.


### Impact

The users cannot successfully invest in certain scenarios due to improper allocation checks. Either users will be prevented from investing (due to the value being too large compared to the allocation limit) or the administrator may be forced to set the allocation too high, which allows users to over-invest and prevents proper control, causing inconsistencies in the investment round.
