# Attacker can frontrun `Claim()` stealing claimers token allocation

### Summary

The `Claim()` function within the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contracts allows a user to claim his allocated token, but due to a lack of validation that the caller is the claimer himself. Knowing that the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` will be deployed on mainnet, this would allow attacker monitoring the mempool, to frontrun the claimers tx and copy the `ClaimParams`, claiming before the user as result stealing his token allocation. 

### Root Cause

Looking at the `Claim` function there's no check that ensures that the caller is authorized to claim.
```solidity 
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
       // ....
        // define token to transfer
        IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);

        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender, // @audit-issue -> No validation whether `msg.sender` is a valid receiver, leading to trivial frontrunning attack
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
     // ...
    }
```
Notice at `safeTransferFrom` call, the receiver is set at `msg.sender`, which would allow an attacker to frontrun and copy the `_params` having a valid signature and the stealing the tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Bob calls `Claim()` with a valid signature
2.  Alice sees Bob tx in mempool
2.a Alice frontruns Bob with same signature
3. Alice tx get validated before Bob
4. She receives the tokens while Bob tx reverts

### Impact

Attacker steals users token allocation due to frontrunning attack

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

- Check whether the caller is the actual claimer:
```solidity 
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
       // ....
                if (msg.sender != _params.kycAddress) {
            revert UnauthorizedClaimer();
        }
     // ...
    }
```
