# Price Staleness Vulnerability in VVVVCInvestmentLedger's Exchange Rate Mechanism

### Summary

The VVVVCInvestmentLedger contract's investment process uses static exchange rates throughout the signature's validity period, enabling sophisticated traders to exploit price differentials during market volatility periods, particularly during token depegging events.

### Root Cause

The exchange rate mechanism lacks real-time price validation, relying solely on pre-signed rates that become stale during the execution window. This architectural decision prioritizes transaction throughput over price accuracy.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Successful KYC verification
- Valid signature from authorized signer
- Available allocation within investment round
- Non-expired deadline timestamp

### External pre-conditions

- Significant market volatility
- Token price deviation from expected stable value
- Liquid secondary markets for arbitrage execution
- Extended signature validity timeframe

### Attack Path

1. Trader identifies investment opportunity with favorable exchange rate
2. Monitors token markets for price instability
3. Upon significant price deviation, acquires tokens at market discount
4. Maintains signed parameters until optimal execution moment
5. Executes investment at original rate despite market changes

### Impact

- Direct financial exposure for investment projects
- Systemic arbitrage opportunities during market stress
- Competitive disadvantage for traditional investors
- Increased risk with volatile token acceptance
- Potential exploitation of stablecoin depegging events
- Scalability of attack across multiple investment rounds

### Mitigation

1. Dynamic price feed integration
2. Maximum price deviation thresholds
3. Shortened signature validity periods
4. Circuit breakers for extreme volatility
5. Two-phase investment confirmation process
6. Regular exchange rate updates with market conditions
