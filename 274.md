# Admin will mismanage funds, impacting protocol transparency and accountability.

### Summary

The lack of restrictions on the recipient address (_to) and the absence of event logging in the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:withdraw` function will cause potential fund mismanagement for the protocol as an authorized admin can direct funds to unintended or malicious addresses without validation or traceability.

### Root Cause
In the [VVVVCInvestmentLedger:withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L248) function:
1. No Restriction on Recipient Address:
The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:withdraw` function allows admins to specify any recipient address (_to) without validation.

2. No Withdrawal Event Logging:
The function does not emit an event to log critical withdrawal details such as the recipient, token address, amount, and caller.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An authorized admin calls the withdraw function.
2. The admin provides:
_to: Any address, potentially malicious or unintended.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Unrestricted Recipient:
Admin specifies _to as:
Their personal wallet.
An unintended address (e.g., address(0) or a blacklisted address).
A malicious third-party address.
The specified token (_tokenAddress) is transferred to the _to address.

2. Lack of Event Logging:
No event is emitted to log the withdrawal details.
Fund movements become difficult to trace, reducing transparency and accountability.


### Impact

1. Affected Parties:
The protocol risks losing control over funds if directed to unintended or malicious addresses.
Investors lose trust in the project due to lack of transparency in fund movements.

2. Potential Loss:
All ERC20 tokens stored in the contract for the specified token.

        // On-chain traceability for this transaction is reduced
    }
}

### Mitigation

1. Restrict Recipient Address (_to): Restrict withdrawals to approved addresses
2. Emit Withdrawal Events: Add event logging for each withdrawal:,.
3. Prevent Zero Address Transfers:Add a check to prevent transfers to address(0):
