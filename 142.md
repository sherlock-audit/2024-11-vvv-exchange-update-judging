# Fee Bypass Vulnerabilities in VVV VC Investment Contract

### Summary

The absence of amountToInvest in signature verification and lack of minimum fee validation will cause fee bypassing vulnerabilities for VVV protocol as VCs can manipulate investment amounts to minimize or eliminate fees.


### Root Cause

1. In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L142 amountToInvest is not included in the signature and VC provide their own investment amount and can reuse the signature multiple times to make investements.

2. In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`, there is no validation on the final calculated fee amount:
```solidity
// Final fee calculation with no minimum check
uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent -
    (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) /
    FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. VC obtains a valid signature for investment parameters
2. VC calculates optimal amountToInvest such that:
   ```solidity
   (amountToInvest * exchangeRateNumerator * feeNumerator) / (exchangeRateDenominator * FEE_DENOMINATOR) < 1
   ```
3. VC calls invest() with the calculated amountToInvest and valid signature
4. The calculated fee rounds to 0 due to integer division
5. VC can repeat this process multiple times to accumulate larger position while paying no fees, since the amountToInvest is not bound by the signature


### Impact

The protocol suffers lost fee revenue as VCs can structure their investments to minimize or eliminate fees.
