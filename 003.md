# If KYC has been provided 2 or more claim signatures, adversary can claim the last to lock the user out of the other ones

### Summary
`claim`  has the following protection to make sure claim signatures are not replayed.

```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;
```

As we can see this does not make sure that if a user is provided multiple signature with different nonces they are used in the correct order.

As the function lacks any access control any user can just use the last signature to lock the KYC'd address out of claiming the previous ones.

### Root Cause

Protocol does not make sure nonces are used in the correct user.

### Attack Path

1. KYC'd user is provided 5 signatures to claim their funds across different tokens 
2. Attacker sends a transaction claiming the user's claim with the highest nonce 
3. The user can't claim the other 4 signatures

### Impact

loss of funds

### Mitigation
