# Malicious User Will Steal Rewards by Front-Running a Claim Transaction

### Summary

A flaw in the handling of the **`msg.sender`** in the `claim` function causes **reward theft** for **valid users**. This occurs when a **malicious user** front-runs the valid user's claim transaction by submitting the same **ClaimParams** data with a higher gas fee. The contract sends the rewards to the **msg.sender**, who is now the malicious user, instead of the intended recipient.


### Root Cause

In the [claim function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106C1-L145C6),  the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contract sends the tokens to the **msg.sender** (the caller of the function) rather than the **kycAddress** specified in the signed **ClaimParams**. This allows a malicious user to front-run the valid user, submit the same **ClaimParams** with a higher gas fee, and receive the rewards. The contract does not ensure that the rewards are sent to the address that the signer authorized (i.e., the **kycAddress**).

```solidity
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        if (claimIsPaused) {
            revert ClaimIsPaused();
        }

        if (_params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length != _params.tokenAmountsToClaim.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

        // define token to transfer
        IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);

        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

        emit VCClaim(
            _params.kycAddress,
            _params.projectTokenAddress,
            _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
            _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
            _params.nonce
        );
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The valid user submits valid **ClaimParams** with a signed message from the authorized signer.
2. The contract uses **msg.sender** as the recipient of the rewards, regardless of the **kycAddress** in the signed message.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A valid user prepares and submits a transaction to call the `claim` function with valid **ClaimParams** signed by the authorized signer.
2. The malicious user monitors the mempool and finds the valid user's pending claim transaction.
3. The malicious user copies the **ClaimParams** from the valid user's transaction and submits the same data with a higher gas fee to front-run the valid user.
4. The malicious user's transaction is mined first, and the contract sends the tokens to **msg.sender** (the malicious user), even though the signature was intended for the **kycAddress**.
5. The valid user's transaction fails because the nonce has already been updated by the malicious user's transaction.


### Impact

The **valid user** suffers a **complete loss of their claimable rewards**. The **malicious user** gains the full amount of tokens that were intended for the valid user by front-running the transaction. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Transfer tokens to the KYC address**: Instead of transferring tokens to **msg.sender**, the contract should transfer tokens to the **kycAddress** specified in the **ClaimParams**. This would ensure that only the intended recipient (the KYC-verified address) can receive the rewards.

```diff
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
-                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
+                 _params.kycAddress,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```

This ensures that the rewards are sent to the **kycAddress** that was authorized by the signed message, preventing the malicious user from stealing the rewards.
