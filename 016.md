# EIP-712 typehash is incorrect for `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol:INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH`

### Summary

The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` contract contains an `INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH` variable
```solidity
bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            bytes(
                "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
            )
        );
```

```solidity
struct InvestParams {
        uint256 investmentRound;
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit;
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp;
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp;
        address paymentTokenAddress;
        address kycAddress;
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation;
        uint256 amountToInvest;
        uint256 exchangeRateNumerator;
        uint256 feeNumerator;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }

### Root Cause

The parameters used in `VVVVCTokenDistributor:INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH` and the parameters inside `VVVVCTokenDistributor:InvestParams` are different causing valid signatures to be invalid.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. user generates a signature based on `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:InvestParams`
2. the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:invest()` function gets called using the generated signature
3. `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:invest()` reverts as there are differences between `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:InvestParams` and `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH` making the signature invalid


### Impact

The signatures generated using the typehash generated from `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:InvestParams` is different from the signature that would be generated from using `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH`  breaking [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) compliancy and therefore contracts or backends that use the correct typehash will end up with invalid signatures. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure parameters inside `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH` and `VVVVCInvestmentLedger:InvestParams` match.
