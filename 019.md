# Using an immutable `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` will invalidate signatures upon hardfork or possible replay attack.

### Summary

Using `block.chainid` to calculate the immutable `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` in the constructors of both `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` will cause signatures to become invalid after a hardfork, as the chain ID value changes but the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` remains immutable.

### Root Cause

In the constructors of `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol`, the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is calculated using `block.chainid` and marked as immutable. This becomes problematic if a blockchain undergoes a hardfork, changing the chainid. Since the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is immutable, it retains the old chainid, leading to invalid signatures and could cause possible replay attacks.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

A blockchain hardfork that changes the `chainid` occurs.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The users cannot successfully verify signatures as the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is incorrect due to the use of an outdated chainid. This results in the inability to execute functions relying on valid signatures, such as claim or invest, rendering portions of the contracts non-functional.

### PoC

Observe the constructors:
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol?plain=1#L127-L134
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol?plain=1#L92-L99

As we can see the chainId is derived and then hardcoded in `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`. so after hard fork, `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` value will remain same and point to incorrect chainId


### Mitigation

Instead of using an immutable `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` initialized with block.chainid in the constructor, introduce a function to allow updating the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` in case of a hardfork or use a mechanism that dynamically generates the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` during signature verification.
