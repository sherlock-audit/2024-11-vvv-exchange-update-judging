# Passing an incorrect investment amount leads to recording incorrect investment data.

### Summary

If the admin records the investment using the investment token instead of the stablecoin, it will lead to an error.

### Root Cause

Vulnerable code:

From the above, we can see that there is no validation for the investment amount, which can lead to issues such as the admin passing a non-stablecoin investment. This could result in errors, or if a zero investment amount is recorded, it could cause subsequent operations to fail or behave incorrectly.

### Internal pre-conditions

When the admin calls the addInvestmentRecords function and passes the uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest, it is an investment amount array that has not been validated.

### External pre-conditions

This leads to the admin recording incorrect investments for the investor. As a result, when the investor later claims project tokens, they may receive an incorrect amount of tokens.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the admin makes an incorrect investment record, and it is irreversible, it will lead to an irreversible error. Additionally, if a zero investment amount is recorded, it will also affect subsequent calculations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I recommend adding a validation check for the uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest when recording investment amounts,When passing parameters, add a token address to check whether it is a stablecoin.as shown below:
```solidity

function addInvestmentRecords(
    address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
    uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
    uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest,
    address _investmentTokenAddress  // New parameter for token address
) external onlyAuthorized {
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];

            // Check if the investment amount is greater than zero
             require(amountToInvest > 0, "Investment amount must be greater than zero");

        // Check if the investment amount matches the expected token type
        // Assuming the expected investment token is a stablecoin
                address expectedToken = address(0xStableCoinAddress);
               require( _investmentTokenAddress == expectedToken, "Investment amount must be in the expected stablecoin type");
               uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
        }
    }
```
I believe this is the best way to ensure the safety of investment records and prevent any potential errors from occurring.
