# Investment Round Timing Vulnerability

### Summary

A reliance on block.timestamp without boundary handling will cause unexpected acceptance or rejection of investments for investors as the investment round's timing may be incorrectly enforced, allowing early or late investments.

### Root Cause

In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`, the investment round timing logic ([place of issue](github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L63)) checks `block.timestamp` against `_params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp` and `_params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp` without explicit safeguards for off-by-one or block propagation delays.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The investment round timestamps are set close to `block.timestamp` without time buffers.

2. Investors attempt investments immediately around the start or end of the round.

### External pre-conditions

1. Miners or validators propagate blocks with slight timestamp variations or delays.

### Attack Path

1. An investor initiates an investment just before or after the exact boundary of `investmentRoundStartTimestamp` or `investmentRoundEndTimestamp`.

2. Due to slight block propagation delays, the contract may accept or reject the investment incorrectly.

### Impact

Investors are affected as their valid investments might be unexpectedly rejected, or invalid investments could be accepted, leading to potential disruption in fundraising.
