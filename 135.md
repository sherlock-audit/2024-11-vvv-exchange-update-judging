# Setting the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.exchangeRateDenominator` too low can prevent tokens from being exchanged for stablecoins

### Summary

If the `exchangeRateDenominator` is set too low, it becomes impossible to exchange tokens to stablecoins. This issue is caused by a mismatch in the required values for `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` when the denominator is set to a very low value (e.g., 1e6). In such cases, there is no valid value for `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` that meets the condition for successful token exchange.

### Root Cause

The problem lies in the following [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L165-L166) of the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest` function:

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator;
```

When the `exchangeRateDenominator` is set too low, such as `1e6`, there is no valid value for `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` that allows a token (e.g., USDT) to be converted into a stablecoin (e.g., USDC) due to the limitations of the `uint256` type, which cannot handle the required values.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `exchangeRateDenominator` is set too low.  
2. The defined stablecoin has a low number of decimals (e.g., 6).  
3. The user tries to invest a token with a higher number of decimals.

### Attack Path

1. Protocol sets a low `exchangeRateDenominator`, such as `1e6` (as in tests), in the `invest` function.  
2. The contract tries to calculate the equivalent stablecoin amount using the formula for `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent`.  
3. The calculation requires a value for `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` that would be extremely small (e.g., `1e-6`), which is impossible to set in a `uint256` variable.  
4. As a result, the function fails to convert the tokens correctly, causing an inability to exchange tokens to stablecoins.

### Impact

This issue can block users from being able to invest, as the exchange between tokens with higher decimals and stablecoins with lower decimals fails to complete properly.

### PoC

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
            exchangeRateDenominator;
```
To invest in the protocol, `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` can't be defined correctly.

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, a validation check should be added to ensure that the `exchangeRateDenominator` is not set to an unreasonably low value. This would prevent the contract from attempting to use `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` values that are too small to be represented by a `uint256`. A suitable minimum threshold should be defined to avoid such calculation errors and ensure smooth exchanges.
