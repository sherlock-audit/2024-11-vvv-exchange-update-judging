# EIP-712 Array Encoding Violation in Token Distributor

### Summary

Non-compliance with EIP-712 array encoding requirements in VVVVCTokenDistributor


### Root Cause

In VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L167, while implementing EIP-712 structured data signing, the contract fails to follow the EIP-712 specification for array encoding which requires arrays to be encoded as the keccak256 hash of their concatenated contents.

The VVVVCTokenDistributor contract fails to meet EIP-712 specification requirements which is explicitly required as per readme 

> Is the codebase expected to comply with any specific EIPs?
> 
> Both VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol and VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol define EIP-712 domain components and utilize EIP-712 structured data formats in validating signature used to validate calls to VVVVCInvestmentLedger:invest() and VVVVCTokenDistributor:claim().
