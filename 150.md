# `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` replay/front-running/reorg attack

### Summary

In `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` a valid call to the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` function can be replayed by a malicious actor to stole the remaining funds from the wallets (the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::projectTokenProxyWallets`) of the OG caller bypassing all the requirements.

### Root Cause

To prevent replay attack of the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` function the `uint256 nonce` has been added to the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::ClaimParams` `struct::ClaimParams`.
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L42
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L51) 

```solidity
    struct ClaimParams {
        address kycAddress;
        address projectTokenAddress;
        address[] projectTokenProxyWallets;
        uint256[] tokenAmountsToClaim;
        uint256 nonce;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }
```
This `nonce` is incremented by one off-chain before calling the `claim` function. However, this value, as of all the other input paramenters can be seen in a blockchain explorer, like `etherscan`(according to the chain this could be `avascan`,`bscscan`,`arbiscan`,`basescan`,`statescan`) by a malicious actor that can retrieve them by decoding the `calldata`. Since there are no requirements in place for the actual `msg.sender` , these parameters will satisfy all of them allowing, this way, malicious actors to stole funds by either replay the call function to `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` using these data but with a `nounce` value incremented by one (also the `ClaimParams.tokenAmountsToClaim` value could be changed if needed), or by front running the OG caller by paying more fees or by exploiting a `blockchain reorg` without the need (in these last 2 cases) to change any data.

```solidity

 function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        if (claimIsPaused) {
            revert ClaimIsPaused();
        }

        if (_params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length != _params.tokenAmountsToClaim.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

        // define token to transfer
        IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);

        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

        emit VCClaim(
            _params.kycAddress,
            _params.projectTokenAddress,
            _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
            _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
            _params.nonce
        );
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

A user has an amount of tokens in the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::projectTokenProxyWallets` and wants to withdraw a part of the funds by calling the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim`.

### External pre-conditions

A malicious actor sees the transaction on the block explorer and retrieve all the input data used by the OG caller and use them just changing the `nonce` value (that has to be incremented by one) to claim/steal, in this way, other funds.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The user (OG caller) can potentially loose all his funds in `VVVVCTokenDistributor::projectTokenProxyWallets` which will be transfered to the attacker `address` as the new `msg.sender`.
```solidity
      for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a requirement/check based on the `msg.sender` to prevent this kind of attack to happen.
