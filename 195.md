# Wrong Investment Accounting Logic for fees and amount invested

### Summary

Fee is taken from the user-invested amount when the fee value is positive. The amount of fees is calculated as:
``` (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;```.
The amount is then deducted from the `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` to get the users investment amount (`postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`). The total amount is then transferred from msg.sender to the contract as shown below.

```solidity
    IERC20(_params.paymentTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _params.amountToInvest
        );
```
The problem is since the whole amountInvest(fees and PostFeeStableAmountEquivalent) is sent to one address the admin who can withdraw the tokens won't be able to differentiate invested amount from fees thus affecting accounting.

### Root Cause

Fees and `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` being sent to same address.

### Internal pre-conditions

Fees is set to a positive value

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bob wants to invest 100USDC
2. Project deducts 10USDC as fee
3. Bobs' `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` == 90
4. The 100USDC is sent to the contract address
5. Admin withdraws 100USDC
6. Bob claims his invested amount and since both fee and invested amount are on one address admin won't be able to differentiate invested amount from the fee amount since the whole amount is also the same added to the investment ledger.

### Impact

Admin won't be able to differentiate invested amount from fees amount


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have a separate address for collecting fees and a different one for investing.
