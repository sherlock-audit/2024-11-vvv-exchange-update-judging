# Frontrunning Vulnerability in claim Function

### Summary

The `claim` function in the contract `VVVVCTokenDistributor` is vulnerable to frontrunning attacks. A malicious actor can monitor the network for pending claim transactions and submit a similar transaction with manipulated parameters before the original one is mined. This can allow the attacker to steal tokens intended for the legitimate claimant.



### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is that the claim function does not bind the off-chain signature to the `msg.sender` on-chain. Without this binding, the signature can be reused by any attacker, allowing them to claim tokens meant for the legitimate user by frontrunning their transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract must have a valid off-chain signature corresponding to the ClaimParams struct.
The legitimate user prepares a transaction with valid parameters and a valid signature.


### External pre-conditions

The attacker has tools (e.g., MEV bots) to modify and submit competing transactions with a higher gas fee to frontrun the original.

### Attack Path

A legitimate user signs and submits a transaction to the claim function, including the required parameters and signature.
The transaction becomes visible in the public Ethereum mempool.
The attacker intercepts the transaction, extracts its parameters and signature.
The attacker crafts a new transaction using the extracted parameters but replaces msg.sender (i.e., their address is used as the sender).
The attacker submits their transaction with a higher gas price, ensuring it is mined first.
The attacker's transaction is processed, successfully transferring tokens intended for the legitimate user.

### Impact

The attacker can steal tokens intended for the legitimate claimant, causing financial loss and eroding trust in the smart contract.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure the off-chain signature includes msg.sender in its parameters. This makes the signature valid only for the intended user, preventing it from being reused by others. For example:
