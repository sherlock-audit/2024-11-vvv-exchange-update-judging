# The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` constructor does not include a check to prevent passing a zero address for its parameters.

### Summary

The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` constructor does not include a check to prevent passing a zero address for its parameters. Without this validation, it is possible to initialize the contract with invalid addresses, which could be problematic as these parameters cannot be updated after deployment.

### Impact
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L123

If the constructor parameters are set to the zero address (0x0), the contract will have a crucial reference set to an invalid address. This could lead to the invalidity and inability to sign investment transactions.


### Mitigation
- Add a check to validate the parameter of _signer
```diff
    constructor(
        address _signer,
        string memory _environmentTag,
        address _authorizationRegistryAddress,
        uint256 _exchangeRateDenominator
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {
+ require(_signer != address(0), "Signer cannot be address 0");
        signer = _signer;
        exchangeRateDenominator = _exchangeRateDenominator;

        // EIP-712 domain separator
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                DOMAIN_TYPEHASH,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked("VVV", _environmentTag)),
                block.chainid,
                address(this)
            )
        );
    }
```
