# Price manipulation will lead to loss of value for protocol

### Summary

because a `InvestParam` is basically a receipt to swap tokens of param.paymentTokenAddress based on stablecoin conversion using numerator and denominator, users can buy up a token just before claim to raise the price and sell it off right before the investing to crash the price.

### Root Cause

The use of numerator and denominator for price conversion assumes the price of the token will be relatively stable, however this can be subject to manipulation that will prevent the protocol from using the full value of invested tokens as `whale` users can collectively dump the token right before investing.

### Internal pre-conditions

There are no internal preconditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. a user receives an offchain InvestParam with `signature` and `exchangeRateNumerator` to invest token A, user sells off large amounts of token A and then invests it for a fixed price due to this conversion used instead of an oracle

`
       uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
            exchangeRateDenominator;`
2. the user basically gets a discount of `(preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - current token price)` which can be manipulated to be as wide as possible, rendering most of the investment tokens almost worthless for the projects that need them

### Impact

Price manipuation renders the investment tokens worthless for the projects that need them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use an oracle for price conversion from `projectToken` to `stablecoin`
