# Claim Process Is Vulnerable To Generalized Frontrunners

### Summary

A generalized frontrunner monitoring the mempool can maliciously claim all tokens by simply detecting a pending transaction to `claim` and executing it themselves at higher transaction gas than the initial caller.

### Root Cause

The claim function's only access control comes in the form of an approval signature made by the `signer`:

```solidity
if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
    revert InvalidSignature();
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L119C9-L121C10

The intention here is that any actor can choose to spend the gas to execute a properly signed approval. Implicitly, this means anyone can execute the `claim` function if they are in possession of a valid signature.

Dangerously, whoever is the one to call this function with the approved signature will be the one to receive the tokens, since:

```solidity
// define token to transfer
IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);

// transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
    projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
        msg.sender, /// @audit Claimed tokens are sent to the `msg.sender`.
        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
    );
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L126C9-L136C10

This means that **anyone in possession of a validly signed `ClaimsParams` can execute a withdrawal and receive the underlying claim, instead of the intended recipient.** 


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Tokens exist on the contract that can be claimed.

### External pre-conditions

1. Signer creates and publishes an authentic claim to funds.

### Attack Path

1. Signer approves a transaction for Alice to claim 10 tokens and sends her the signed `ClaimParams`, granting her access to invoke the `claim` function and receive some tokens.
2. Alice, a home staker, invokes her `claim` by publishing her transaction to the public mempool using her home node.
3. Bob, a generalized frontrunner takes the claim and replays the transaction using his address, and notices he accrues profit by doing so.
4. Bob retransmits the transaction via PBS and incentivices his transaction to be included more quickly.

### Impact

Generalized frontrunners may steal all `ClaimParams` that are published to the public mempool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The signed proof should implicitly ensure the intended recipient:

```diff
projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
    _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
-   msg.sender,
+   _params.tokenRecipients[i],
    _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
);
```
