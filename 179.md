# Unable to claim due frontrunning and stealing investment

### Summary

Malicious users could investors to claim investments, which permanently lock their funds in the contract.

### Root Cause

The following snippet includes a nonce, which can be any number greater than the previous nonce to prevent replay attacks. However, it lacks a try-catch block to guard against potential frontrunning denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and allows the caller to specify the nonce. Additionally, a frontrunner could exploit this by stealing the specified tokens, as `msg.sender` is not restricted to the KYC address provided by the original signer.

```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }
          -- SNIP --
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;
          -- SNIP --
        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender, //@audit
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1) There must be tokens within `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contract.

### Attack Path

1) Alice calls the `claim()` submitting signature
2) Bob monitor the mempool and frontrun the signature using the extracted parameters from Alice's Transaction, submitting a transaction with an incremented nonce within the before the deadline specified by Alice.
3) When the Alice's transaction is executed, the on-chain nonce will differ from the nonce in the signature, and the transaction will revert.

### Impact

User is unable to claim back their investments from this contract, having the investment stolen by frontrunner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1) Introduce an allowance check for the claimer, continue if allowance is higher.

2) Or implement `claim()` a check if the transaction has been executed:
```solidity
	require(!executed[hashed], "tx already executed");
        executed[hashed] = true;
```

Lastly ensure that `msg.sender` is replaced with either kycAddress in the signature or create another params for alias address.
```diff
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
--                msg.sender, 
++              _params.kycAddress, 
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
```
