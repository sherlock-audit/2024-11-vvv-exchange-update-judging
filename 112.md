# User can replay investment signature to add more record to the ledger

### Summary

Investment signature is signed with multiple parameters, and `exchangeRateNumerator` is the numerator of the conversion of payment token to stablecoin (i.e. VVV to USDC).

[VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L60-L73](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L60-L73):
```solidity
    struct InvestParams {
        uint256 investmentRound;
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit;
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp;
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp;
        address paymentTokenAddress;
        address kycAddress;
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation;
        uint256 amountToInvest;
@>      uint256 exchangeRateNumerator;
        uint256 feeNumerator;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }
```

Signer may use different `exchangeRateNumerator` value to sign investment signatures, to reflect the payment token price correctly, i.e. the higher the price, the higher the `exchangeRateNumerator`. However, the signature can be replayed to invest with the same `exchangeRateNumerator` value, and user can add more record to the ledger than expected.

### Root Cause

The culprit is that there is no `nonce` in `InvestParams` struct, hence the signature can be replayed. 

### Internal pre-conditions

An investment signature is signed by the signer. 

### External pre-conditions

Within investment round period, the payment token price drops after the investment signature is signed but before the signature is expired

### Attack Path

User replays investment signature to invest with a higher `exchangeRateNumerator`, therefore they can add more record to the ledger than expected.

### Impact

User adds more record to the ledger than expected.

### PoC

```solidity
    function testAudit_replay() public {
        VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature(
            sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0],
            investmentRoundSampleLimit,
            sampleAmountsToInvest[0],
            userPaymentTokenDefaultAllocation,
            exchangeRateNumerator,
            feeNumerator,
            sampleKycAddress,
            activeRoundStartTimestamp,
            activeRoundEndTimestamp
        );

        vm.startPrank(sampleUser, sampleUser);
        PaymentTokenInstance.approve(address(LedgerInstance), params.amountToInvest);
        LedgerInstance.invest(params);

        assertEq(LedgerInstance.kycAddressInvestedPerRound(sampleKycAddress, 1), 900000000);

        PaymentTokenInstance.approve(address(LedgerInstance), params.amountToInvest);
        LedgerInstance.invest(params);

        assertEq(LedgerInstance.kycAddressInvestedPerRound(sampleKycAddress, 1), 900000000 * 2);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```


### Mitigation

Add `nonce` to `InvestParams` struct to prevent replaying.
