# The protocol is not EIP-712 compliant on multiple occasions

### Summary

The problem is that the contract is supposed to be EIP-712 compliant but it does not implement the corresponding functionality in multiple places.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in a fact that the protocol does not adhere to the EIP-712 standard documentation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The contracts do not comply with EIP-712 as required to be by the contest readme. Contracts or dapps/backends that use "correct" typehashes that match the parameters of these functions will end up generating different signatures, causing them to revert when called.

### PoC

According to the contest README:

```solidity
Both VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol and VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol define EIP-712 domain components and utilize EIP-712 structured data formats in validating signature used to validate calls to VVVVCInvestmentLedger:invest() and VVVVCTokenDistributor:claim().
```

However, there are several places where the contracts in-scope of the audit do not comply with the standard:

1. Typehash mismatch with the actual struct:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L60-73
```solidity
struct InvestParams {
        uint256 investmentRound;
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit;
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp;
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp;
        address paymentTokenAddress;
        address kycAddress;
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation;
        uint256 amountToInvest;
        uint256 exchangeRateNumerator;
        uint256 feeNumerator;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }
```


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L19-24
```solidity
 bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            bytes(
                "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
            )
        );
```

As you can see here, the `signature` parameter is included in the struct but not included in the typehash. Later on, the `signature` is checked to be derived from the `signer` address (from the provided input):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L212-235
```solidity
 function _isSignatureValid(InvestParams memory _params) internal view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.investmentRound,
                        _params.investmentRoundLimit,
                        _params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp,
                        _params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp,
                        _params.paymentTokenAddress,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.kycAddressAllocation,
                        _params.exchangeRateNumerator,
                        _params.feeNumerator,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
                )
            )
        );

        address recoveredAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, _params.signature);

```

In this case, it's not needed to be included in the struct at all. According to the EIP-712 spec:

```solidity
The hashStruct function is defined as
hashStruct(s : ùïä) = keccak256(typeHash ‚Äñ encodeData(s)) 
```


2. The typehash is incorrectly created.

According to the referenced spec documentation above, the typehash is just a keccak256 of a struct data. But in the current implementation, it's not implemented like that:

```solidity

  bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            bytes(
                "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
            )
        );
```

Instead, it converts the string itself into bytes which is not expected.

3. Arrays are incorrectly encoded.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L157-174
```solidity
 function _isSignatureValid(ClaimParams memory _params) private view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
                        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
                        _params.nonce,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
                )
            )
        );
```

As you can see here, it's just `abi.encode()` function towards arrays of `projectTokenProxyWallets` and `tokenAmountsToClaim` but, according to the spec:

```solidity
The array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated encodeData of their contents (i.e. the encoding of SomeType[5] is identical to that of a struct containing five members of type SomeType).
```

Therefore, these parameters has to be encoded like that:

```solidity
keccak256(abi.encodePacked( _params.projectTokenProxyWallets),
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_params.tokenAmountsToClaim),
```


### Mitigation

Mitigation is done by strictly following EIP-712 specification.
