# H-3: Abuse of Per-Address Allocation Limits via Multiple KYC Addresses Allows an Attacker to Monopolize Investments Across Rounds

### Summary

The protocol's isolation of per-round investment data and reliance on per-address allocation limits enable attackers to register multiple KYC addresses under their control. By splitting investments across these addresses, an attacker can bypass allocation limits and dominate investments in a round, thereby excluding legitimate participants. This behavior extends across multiple rounds, allowing sustained exploitation.

### Root Cause

In the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol:183` the protocol relies on per-address allocation limits, tracked via:
```solidity
kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.kycAddress][_params.investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
````
However, it does not detect relationships between KYC addresses or enforce global allocation limits across addresses. This enables an attacker to:
-Register multiple KYC addresses.
-Split their total desired investment across these addresses, each remaining under the individual cap.

### Internal pre-conditions

`-The protocol tracks investments on a per-KYC address basis:
```solidity
kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound];
```
2-There is no mechanism to link or correlate multiple KYC addresses under a single entity.


### External pre-conditions

1-The attacker has access to multiple KYC addresses under their control.
2-The centralized system approves all submitted investment parameters and signatures without detecting KYC address ownership relationships.


### Attack Path

1- The attacker registers multiple KYC addresses under their control (e.g., KYC1, KYC2, KYC3).
2-In Round 1:
For each KYC address, the attacker invests just below the per-address allocation limit:
```solidity
if (postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound) {
    revert ExceedsAllocation();
}
```
This ensures the total allocation is maximized while staying within protocol-defined limits.
3-The attacker repeats the process across all KYC addresses, inflating their total investment far beyond what a legitimate user could achieve with a single KYC address.
4-In Round 2:
- The attacker repeats the same process, using the same KYC addresses to monopolize the round.
- By dominating allocations in consecutive rounds, the attacker blocks legitimate users from participating.


### Impact

# Affected Party: 
Legitimate users and the protocol.
- Legitimate Users:
-Are excluded from participating due to inflated demand and limited available allocation.
-Lose access to fair investment opportunities, leading to dissatisfaction and reputational harm to the protocol.
- Protocol:
-Tracks inflated per-round investments without realizing they originate from a single malicious entity.
-Suffers from reduced decentralization and trust due to unfair allocation.
# Severity: 
High. This issue directly undermines the fairness and integrity of the protocolâ€™s allocation system.

### PoC

# Setup
1-Deploy ```VVVVCInvestmentLedger``` with a per-address allocation limit of 500,000.
2-An attacker registers three KYC addresses (KYC1, KYC2, KYC3).
# Exploit Steps
1-For Round 1, the attacker generates valid signatures for each KYC address:
```solidity
InvestParams memory paramsKYC1 = InvestParams({
    investmentRound: 1,
    investmentRoundLimit: 1_000_000,
    investmentRoundStartTimestamp: block.timestamp,
    investmentRoundEndTimestamp: block.timestamp + 1 hours,
    paymentTokenAddress: 0xTokenAddress,
    kycAddress: 0xKYC1,
    kycAddressAllocation: 500_000,
    amountToInvest: 499_000,
    exchangeRateNumerator: 1,
    feeNumerator: 10,
    deadline: block.timestamp + 1 hours,
    signature: validSignatureKYC1
});
```
2-Submit similar investments for KYC2 and KYC3, ensuring each stays just below the allocation limit.
3-Observe that the total allocation for Round 1 is consumed entirely by the attacker:
```solidity
totalInvestedPerRound[1] = 499_000 + 499_000 + 499_000 = 1_497_000;
```
4-In Round 2, repeat the process, ensuring the attacker dominates allocations across rounds.

### Mitigation

-Improve Off-Chain Validation:

- Require the centralized system to perform additional checks, such as:
-IP address correlation.
-Identity linking across KYC registrations.
-Time-based monitoring to detect patterns of abuse.
