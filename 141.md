# Front-Running Vulnerability in VVVVCInvestmentLedger Contract Allows Investment Limit Bypass

### Summary

The lack of limit validation in addInvestmentRecords() will cause an investment limit bypass vulnerability for the protocol as VCs can front-run admin record additions to exceed their allocation limits or overall round allocation limit.

### Root Cause

In VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L273,  the addInvestmentRecords() function directly increments investment amounts without checking against round or user allocation limits.

### Attack Path


1. VC makes legitimate off-chain investment of 5,000 USDC
2. Protocol admin prepares to record this 5,000 USDC investment via `addInvestmentRecords()`
3. VC monitors mempool for their expected investment record transaction
4. Upon seeing the record transaction, VC calculates maximum possible on-chain investment:
   - Round limit remaining: 20,000 USDC
   - Their allocation remaining: 10,000 USDC
   - Expected off-chain record: 5,000 USDC
   - Therefore can invest 10,000 USDC on-chain now (limit will be exceeded by off-chain record)
5. VC submits `invest()` transaction with higher gas price for 10,000 USDC
6. Original `addInvestmentRecords()` for 5,000 USDC executes after
7. Final state:
   - On-chain investment: 10,000 USDC 
   - Off-chain investment record: 5,000 USDC
   - Total: 15,000 USDC (exceeds intended 10,000 USDC limit for the VC)


### Impact

The protocol suffers a violation of investment round limits and individual allocation limits. This may have various impact, for example, an unintended VC gaining more share/ control.
