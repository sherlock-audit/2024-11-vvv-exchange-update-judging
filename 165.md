# Lack of a feature that allows `kycAddress`es to increase their nonce.

## Summary

The `claim()` function requires the nonce of the `ClaimParams` to be greater than that of the `kycAddress`. This nonce mechanism is in place to prevent the execution of duplicate transactions. Typically, a nonce mechanism is accompanied by an invalidation feature, allowing the nonce owner to proactively invalidate the current nonce by increasing it. However, the current design does not provide a way to increase the nonce, meaning that `kycAddress`es cannot invalidate already signed `ClaimParams`.

## Root Cause

As noted in [line 115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L115) of the `claim()` function, `_params.nonce` must be greater than the nonce of the `kycAddress`.

The nonce of the `kycAddress` only increases when a claim is executed (see [line 124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L124)).

As a result, the `kycAddress` cannot invalidate their currently signed `ClaimParams`.

```solidity
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        ...

115     if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        ...

124     nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

        ...
    }
```

## Internal pre-conditions

## External pre-conditions

## Attack Path

## Impact

`kycAddress`es do not have a mechanism to invalidate already signed `ClaimParams`.

## PoC

## Mitigation

Add a function that allows `kycAddress`es to increase their nonce in order to invalidate already signed `ClaimParams`.
