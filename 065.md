# No minimal amount check for amountToInvest allow users to avoid commission fees

### Summary

InvestmentLedger works as follows. A trusted person (signer) creates a signature in which he sets the kycAddress in which users can invest as well as other parameters of the invest structure.
```solidity
    struct InvestParams {
        uint256 investmentRound; // The round of the investment
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit; //  iThe limit of the investment round
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp; // The start timestamp of the investment round
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp; // The end timestamp of the investment round
        address paymentTokenAddress; // The address of the payment token
        address kycAddress; // The address of the kyc address
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation; // The max amount the kyc address can invest
        uint256 amountToInvest; // The amount of paymentToken to invest
        uint256 exchangeRateNumerator; // The numerator of the conversion of payment token to stablecoin (i.e. VVV to USDC)
        uint256 feeNumerator; // The numerator of the fee subtracted from the investment stable-equivalent amount
        uint256 deadline; // The deadline for the investment
        bytes signature; //  The signature of the investment
    }
```

Looking at the investment typehash we will see that the only parameter that is not included is amountToInvest

```solidity
    bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            bytes(
                "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
            )
        );
```

Judging by the tests (consider the [`VVVVVCTestBase::getEIP712SignatureForInvest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/test/vc/VVVVCTestBase.sol#L132) function - this is done for a reason. AmountToInvest is the only parameter the user can control. All other parameters are passed from a trusted entity.

The point is that amountToInvest directly affects the commission that the user will pay to the protocol. Since amountToInvest can be made very small and it is not validated in any way - due to rounding it is possible to avoid the fee, and by summing up such transactions - to avoid the fee for the whole amount.

### Root Cause

amountToInvest - the parameter passed by the user is not controlled in any way for the minimum value, which allows you to achieve rounding down when calculating commissions and break your payment into minimum parts.
```solidity
 uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
            exchangeRateDenominator;

 // the post-fee stableAmountEquivalent, to contribute toward user and round limits
        uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent -
            (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) /
            FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```
Since all parameters exchangeRateNumerator, exchangeRateDenominator, feeNumerator, FEE_DENOMINATOR are known in advance - we can always find a sufficient amount to invest in order to zero the commissions.

### Internal pre-conditions

Signer should publish a signature to invest kycAddress

(Here I would like to note that the signature is issued one for all users, i.e. as long as the parameters given in the signature are valid (in the main timeframe and deadline, as well as invest/supply limits) - it can be used by any address for donation, controlling only amountToInvest). 

### External pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

The user, knowing the external signature parameters, selects such a value of amountToInvest that fee = 0. For example, for the test values
exchangeRateNumerator = 1e6, exchangeRateDenominator = 1e6, feeNumerator = 1000, FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10,000 - such value will be amountToInvest = 9.

Then it splits its amount into many transactions with a minimum amount and can control the amount of the paid commission.

### Impact

The obvious weakness of this bug is the fact that the user will overpay more for the network's commission by doing this than they will earn from saving commissions. However, below I will try to give arguments why this deserves severity: Medium

1) The user doesn't have to try to avoid the commission fee entirely, they can simply choose the right parameters to minimise it.

2) All users of the system can do the same. That is, as I mentioned above - the signature is not unique for each investor, it can be used by absolutely everyone.

Thus, let's say the signature gives investLimit = 100 USDC. It is not necessarily that it will be reached by the investment of one user. This limit is reached by all users, and taking into account that everyone can make such an attack - the fee for commissions per user decreases with the amount of his investment. Thus, in the worst case 100 USDC will be gained without a single commission (according to test data 10 USDC will be los

3) Among the networks on which the protocol will work there are cheaper networks in contrast to mainnet, where commissions can be considered zero.

All of this in my opinion makes this problem essential to the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add minimal amountToInvest check >= 10,000. It is extremely low value even for tokens with 6 decimals, but with this users cant avoid paying fees for investing.
