# Frontrunning vulnerability in VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords allows exceeding investment limits

### Summary

An attacker can frontrun the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords` transaction to exceed the investment amount limit. This is due to the absence of limit checks in the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords` function when accumulating the invested amount.

### Root Cause

As the protocol states: "`addInvestmentRecords` could be called by an admin at any time".

![protocol](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/858f5e6b-8f3b-400e-b18d-e45f41411299)

However, in the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords` function, when setting the accumulated invested amount for a KYC address and the total invested amount for an investment round, the function does not check whether these amounts exceed the investment limits for the KYC address or the investment round. 
This flaw allows an attacker to frontrun the admin's transaction by calling the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest` function with parameters that adhere to the limits. After both transactions are successfully executed, the invested amount for a KYC address or a round exceeds the intended limit.

[VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256) function:

```javascript
function addInvestmentRecords(
    address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
    uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
    uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
) external onlyAuthorized {
    ...
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
        address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
        uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
        uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

        kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
        totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
        emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
    }
}
```

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors transactions in the mempool.
2. An admin sends a transaction by calling the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords` function.
3. The attacker detects this transaction and sends a transaction to call the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest` function with suitable parameters and a higher gas fee.
4. The attacker's transaction is executed before the admin's transaction. Consequently, both transactions succeed, and the attacker achieves their goal.

### Impact

The invested amount limit for a KYC address or an investment round can be exceeded.

### Mitigation

The protocol should call the `setInvestmentIsPaused` function before calling the `addInvestmentRecords` function.
