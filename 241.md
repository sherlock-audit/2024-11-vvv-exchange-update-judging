# Incorrect fee implementation will break investment limits for the protocol

### Summary

The fee handling implementation contradicts the README specification, as fees that are signed off-chain are only used for accounting but not actually taken from the user's investment amount. This breaks the documented protocol invariant and causes a discrepancy between recorded investments and actual token holdings.

### Root Cause

The choice to implement fee handling incorrectly is a mistake as it breaks the protocol's documented behavior.
In [`VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol:168-186`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L168C1-L193C11 )  
the off-chain signed fee is only applied to accounting values while the full amount is transferred, contradicting the README which states "A fee (signature parameter defined off-chain) is only taken from the user-invested amount when the fee value is positive":
```solidity
// Fee only reduces accounting amount
@> uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent =
    preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;

// Records reduced (post-fee) amount
kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.kycAddress][_params.investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
totalInvestedPerRound[_params.investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;

// But transfers full (pre-fee) amount
@> IERC20(_params.paymentTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _params.amountToInvest);
```

### Internal pre-conditions


1. Admin needs to sign an investment authorization with non-zero `feeNumerator` creating a valid signature
2. Investment round limit needs to be set to any non-zero value
3. KYC address allocation needs to be set to any non-zero value

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A round has investment limit of 900 USDC (in stable equivalent)
2. Admin signs an authorization for investment with:
   - `amountToInvest`: 1000 tokens
   - `feeNumerator`: 1000 (10% fee)
   - `exchangeRateNumerator/denominator`: 1:1 (for simplicity, 1 token = 1 USDC)
3. User calls `invest()` with these parameters
4. Contract calculates:
   - `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` = 1000 USDC
   - `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` = 900 USDC (after 10% fee)
5. Check passes because 900 USDC <= 900 USDC round limit
6. Contract:
   - Records 900 USDC in `totalInvestedPerRound`
   - But actually transfers full 1000 tokens (worth 1000 USDC)
7. Result: Round holds 1000 USDC worth of tokens despite 900 USDC limit


### Impact

The protocol contradicts its own documented behavior regarding fee handling. The README states fees are "taken from the user-invested amount" but they are only applied to accounting. This leads to:
1. Inaccurate investment tracking as recorded amounts don't match actual holdings
2. Potential bypass of round limits since they're checked against post-fee amounts
3. Break of protocol invariant explicitly stated in README

For example, in a round with 1M USDC limit and 10% fee, users could actually invest 1.11M USDC while system records only 1M USDC

### PoC

none

### Mitigation


The current implementation has fees that serve no actual purpose since they:
1. Only affect accounting but not real token movements
2. Are signed off-chain but their purpose isn't clear
3. Create misleading differences between recorded amounts and actual holdings

Two potential approaches to fix this:

1. If fees are meant to be actually taken:
   - Clarify in documentation where the fee tokens should go (fee recipient)
   - Modify off-chain signing process to include fee recipient
   - Modify contract to actually transfer fee amounts to the designated recipient
   - Ensure accounting matches actual token movements

2. If fees aren't meant to be taken:
   - Remove fee logic entirely since it serves no purpose
   - Use actual invested amounts for accounting
   - Update documentation to remove mentions of fees being "taken from user-invested amount"
   - Ensure investment limits are enforced on actual token amounts

Note: The exact implementation would depend on the intended purpose of the fees in the protocol design, which should be clarified before choosing a mitigation path.
