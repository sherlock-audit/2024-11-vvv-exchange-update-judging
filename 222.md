# Frontrunning Vulnerability in claim() Function Leading to Loss of Rewards

### Summary

The claim() function in the VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol file allows users to claim their rewards. However, it transfers the rewards to the msg.sender rather than the address specified in the ClaimParams struct. This design introduces a vulnerability where an attacker can frontrun the transaction and claim rewards belonging to legitimate users by observing the transaction details in the mempool. As a result, the attacker can steal the rewards, leaving the legitimate user unable to claim them.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the implementation of the claim() function, which transfers rewards to msg.sender instead of the intended recipient. This behavior enables attackers to frontrun transactions and claim rewards belonging to legitimate users by copying the transaction data, including the signature.

### Attack Path

1. User sends the transaction to claim the rewards.
2. Transaction is submitted to the mempool.

### Mitigation

```diff
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
--                msg.sender,
++              _params.kycAddress,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```
