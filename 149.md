# When a KYC-Investor `VVVCTokenInvestmentLedger.sol::Invest`,  Non-KYC investors  can also invest

### Summary

When a NON-KYC investor wants `VVVCTokenInvestmentLedger.sol::Invest` , which is meant to be function for only KYCed investors, a non KYC investor can call `invest` with the signature of the previous KYC ed` investor as there no checks if the KYC Address is the right one or not.

### Root Cause

When `VVVCTokenInvestmentLedger.sol::Invest` is called, it will first checks if the signature is true, but it does not check it is already been used by a previous KYC investor.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141-#L205

```solidity
    function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
        //check if investments are paused
        if (investmentIsPaused) revert InvestmentPaused();

        // check if signature is valid
        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

```
This will cause everyone to being able to invest just by getting a previous signature from KYC investor that called `invest`, 



```solidity
  struct ClaimParams {
        address kycAddress;
        address projectTokenAddress;
        address[] projectTokenProxyWallets;
        uint256[] tokenAmountsToClaim;
        uint256 nonce;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }
```
    
Signature can be freely reused as checks are only if the signature is valid and the deadline has not expired.


```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Checks if the provided signature is valid
     * @param _params A ClaimParams struct containing the investment parameters
     * @return true if the signer address is recovered from the signature, false otherwise
     */
    function _isSignatureValid(ClaimParams memory _params) private view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
                        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
                        _params.nonce,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
                )
            )
        );

        address recoveredAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, _params.signature);

        bool isSigner = recoveredAddress == signer;
        bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;
        return isSigner && !isExpired;q
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A KYC investor needs to invest beforehand.

### External pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

NON KYC INVESTOR:
1. Wait for a KYC investor to call the  `invest` function.
2. Get his signature that got broadcasted with the params
3. NON KYC investor has invested without KYC.

### Impact

People will no KYC will be able to invest.

### PoC

Manual review

### Mitigation

Nonces, or making sure the signature has not been used before & Checks to if a msg.sender is a KYC address.
