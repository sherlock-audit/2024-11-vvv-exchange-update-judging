# Users will be blocked if they claim at a later epoch

### Summary

[claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106-L145) allows users to claim their fair amounts of project tokens, where as every claim claims all the tokens for this round. Each round has it's own nonce, which is used to protect against signature replay-ability. This nonce is later set to this map - `nonces[_params.kycAddress]`.

```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;
```

However setting the nonce, instead of increasing it will cause all unclaimed pass rounds to be lost and their funds to be stuck.

```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }
```

### Root Cause

Setting the nonce
```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

nonce, everything is hard coded

### External pre-conditions

User to claim for a few rounds in a row

### Attack Path

The system generates each nonce for every round the user has invested for, so nonce 1 for round 1, 2 for 2 and so on...

1. Alice invest in rounds 1,2,3
2. She claims for round 1 just as it's finished, using nonce 1
3. She comes later when 2 and 3 are ready
4. She claims 3 first as it's more valuable, using nonce 3

Alice's second round is locked forever as this check will fail

```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }
```

### Impact

User funds are locked

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Increase the nonce by one for each claim, or better yet, use pull instead of push,  i.e. the users to claim their allocated tokens instead of the system sending them.
