# A malicious attacker can frontrun the `claim()` function

### Summary
The `claim()` function is intended for claiming project tokens. However, it transfers the project tokens to the caller without verifying whether the caller is an alias of a KYC address. As a result, a malicious attacker can frontrun the `claim()` function and steal the project tokens from the original callers.

### Root Cause
The root causes lies in the following code at line 133.

```solidity
File: vvv-platform-smart-contracts\contracts\vc\VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol
129:         // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
130:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
131:             projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
132:                 _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
133: @>              msg.sender,
134:                 _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
135:             );
136:         }
```
It transfers the project tokens to `msg.sender`. However, it does not verify if `msg.sender` is an alias of the `_params.kycAddress`. 

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
An alias of a KYC address calls the `claim()` function to claim the project tokens.

### Attack Path
An attacker monitors the mempool and detects a transaction initiated by an alias of a KYC address to claim the project tokens with a valid signature. The attacker then frontruns the transaction using the same payload but with a higher gas fee.

### Impact
A malicious attacker can steal all tokens from KYC addresses.

### Mitigation
It is recommended to verify the validity of `msg.sender` in the `claim()` function.
