# Both contracts are not as per coding standard of Polkadot

### Summary

here as sponsor has said, chains on which this is to be deployed is polkadot too. Now the concern is current smart contract will be not be compatible. As here address is used as a datatype and which is not there in polkadot .

### Root Cause

As it is to be deployed on non evm chains too, but here as it is to deployed on polakdot, address should not be used.
