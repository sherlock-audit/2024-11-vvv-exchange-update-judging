# Protocol does not support non-evm polkadot chain

### Summary

vVv Launchpad is supposed to support different chains, not only EVM. These chains can have a different address standard, like Polkadot. In Polkadot. address can't work in they support string.

Following is technical point of polkadot
- Normally in Polkadot we use 32-bytes-long AccountId accompanied with Schnorrkel/Ristretto sr25519 algorithm for keys and signing, and blake2 for hashing.
- Ethereum standard is 20-bytes-long AccountId and ECDSA secp256k1 key pairs in combination with keccak256 hash function.
