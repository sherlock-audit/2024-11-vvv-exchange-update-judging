# Possibility of Users Being Unable to Invest Due to the Use of `block.timestamp` on the Arbitrum Chain

## Description  

First, let's understand how `block.timestamp` works on [Arbitrum](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time#block-timestamps-arbitrum-vs-ethereum):  

- Block timestamps are updated based on the sequencer's clock.  
  
- Each block timestamp must:  
  
  1. Be equal to or greater than the timestamp of the previous L2 block.  
   
  2. Stay within a specific range:  

     - It can be no earlier than 24 hours before the current time.  
     - It can be no later than 1 hour into the future.  

Now, if we examine the [VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L137-L205) function, we see a [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L150-L156) that ensures users can only invest in an active investment round (i.e., one that has not ended):  

```javascript
function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
    // ...

    // Check if the investment round is active
    if (
        block.timestamp < _params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp ||
        block.timestamp > _params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp
    ) {
        revert InactiveInvestmentRound();
    }

    // ...
}
```

Three issues may arise here:  

1. A user is unable to invest in a round because the `block.timestamp` reports a time within 24 hours earlier than `_params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp`, causing a revert.  
2. A user tries to invest in a round close to its end (e.g., 30 minutes remaining), but the `block.timestamp` reports a time 1 hour in the future, resulting in a revert. This causes the user to miss the opportunity.  
3. An investment round may last longer than intended because, as stated in the Arbitrum docs, the `block.timestamp` can be equal to the previous timestamp, potentially delaying the round's end.  

## Impact  

- **Damage**: Medium  
- **Likelihood**: Medium  

**Impact Details**:  

Users may be unable to invest in specific rounds due to inconsistencies of `block.timestamp` in Arbitrum and as Result miss Investment opportunities.

## Proof of Concept  

**Attack Path**:  

1. Assume an active investment round with only 30 minutes left until it ends.  
2. A user sees this as a good investment opportunity and calls the `invest()` function with valid `InvestParams`.  
3. The `invest()` function checks if the round is active using `block.timestamp`. On Arbitrum, `block.timestamp` may report a time 1 hour in the future.  
4. This causes the check to revert, and the user is unable to invest in the desired round.  

**POC**:  

- Not Needed  

## Recommended Mitigation  

`VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contract deployed on Arbitrum, investment rounds should be started and ended by an admin or an off-chain bot calling specific function.

Also The duration of the investment round should be displayed on the VVV website front-end to ensure clarity for users.
