# The same signature can be used to invest multiple times before it expires, allowing malicious users to invest at a profitable exchange rate if the payment token's price falls

### Summary

Signatures in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` can be reused multiple times before their expiration. In the event that the price of the payment token falls before the signature expires, then a malicious user can invest multiple times at a profitable exchange rate (higher rate) and become eligible for more rewards on the vVv platform.

### Root Cause

The signature implementation in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` does not use nonce to protect against signature replay attacks. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L212C1-L241C1). It uses a deadline only. Additionally, the exchange rate is calculated using an off-chain service instead of using on-chain price feeds from an oracle (Chainlink, Pyth, etc). Malicious users can generate a signature when the payment token's price with respect to a stablecoin (USDC, USDT, etc) is high, and once the price drops before the signature expiration, send the investment transaction. This provides them with a higher exchange rate than the current exchange rate. They can use the same signature to invest multiple times before it expires (until the max investment allocation for their KYC address is not breached), essentially making them eligible for more rewards on the vVv platform (via the `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` contract).

### Internal pre-conditions

The malicious user needs to generate a signature using vVv's off-chain service with a reasonable deadline (5-10 minutes is sufficient for considerable price movements for many volatile cryptocurrencies).

### External pre-conditions

Price of the payment token needs to fall sufficiently enough for the malicious user to be able to get a profitable exchange rate.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user generates a signature using vVv's off-chain service.
2. They wait for the price to fall before the signature expires. If the price doesn't fall, they can decide to not send the transaction at all (or send the first transaction and not reuse the signature, depending on how the off-chain service is set up).
3. If the price falls, the user sends the investment transaction over and over again (until the max investment allocation for their KYC address is not breached) and invests at a profitable rate.

### Impact

The protocol is tricked into registering a user's investment at a higher exchange rate. This also enables the user to be eligible for more rewards on the vVv platform.

### PoC

Add the following test case to `vvv-platform-smart-contracts/test/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.unit.t.sol`,

```solidity
    function testCanInvestMultipleTimesUsingTheSameSignature() public {
        // Lets assume a user wants to invest 1000 tokens for investment round 1 where the exchange rate between the token and USDC is 1:1
        uint256 amountToInvest = 1000e6;
        uint256 sampleExchangeRateNumerator = 1e6; // exchangeRateDenominator here is 1e6
        uint256 fee = 0; // For simplicity, let's consider 0% fees taken
        VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature(
            sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0],
            investmentRoundSampleLimit,
            amountToInvest,
            userPaymentTokenDefaultAllocation,
            sampleExchangeRateNumerator,
            fee,
            sampleKycAddress,
            activeRoundStartTimestamp,
            activeRoundEndTimestamp
        );

        // The signature generated has a deadline of 1 hour, but it's more reasonable to have a deadline of 5-10 minutes
        // The user invests for a first time
        investAsUser(sampleUser, params);

        // Now assume the value of the token went down by 5% in the next 5 minutes, which is totally possible in the crypto world
        // However, since the signature hasn't expired yet, we can use it again to invest at a profitable rate
        advanceBlockNumberAndTimestampInSeconds(5 minutes);
        // The investment succeeds
        investAsUser(sampleUser, params);
    }
```

Here's the test result,

```shell
Ran 1 test for test/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.unit.t.sol:VVVVCInvestmentLedgerUnitTests
[PASS] testCanInvestMultipleTimesUsingTheSameSignature() (gas: 215255)
Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 13.08ms (1.83ms CPU time)
```

### Mitigation

Use nonces to disallow reusing the same signature. Also use an on-chain oracle service instead of calculating exchange rates off-chain, as there might be a disparity between when the signature is generated and when the transaction is included in a block.
