# Using other ERC20 Tokens than `USDC` that have different decimals (e.g `DAI` with 18 decimals) will break calculation for `invest()` function

### Summary

When `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` is deployed then the `exchangeRateDenominator` value is also set in the constructor and is set as an **immutable** variable. Let's see as an example is `USDC` (because this is main token on contest README) token then the `exchangeRateDenominator = 1e6` because `USDC` has 6 decimals.

This can be a problem if the token used has different decimals than `USDC`, for example `DAI` which has 18 decimals as the sponsor [said](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1306634803470139443/1306879616941686845):

> it'd be per-round, one round could be USDC, the next USDT, the next DAI etc. all per-round set exchange rates based on value, decimals
> 

To make it clearer, let's look at the formula for converting invest tokens to stablecoin token value in the `invest()` function :

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
                                       exchangeRateDenominator;
```

As an example :
Invest token = `DAI` (18 decimals), with amount = 1

The calculation will be :

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent  = (1e18 * 1e18) / 1e6
                                      = 1e30
```

In this way, the calculation for the allocation limit for each round and the calculation for the total investment allocation limit will be broken.

The main problem here is that the `exchangeRateDenominator` is set as `immutable` and cannot be changed so that the investment token is no longer flexible and must have the same decimal. As a primary example is `USDC` which has 6 decimals then all investment tokens must have 6 decimals.

### Root Cause

*In [VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol:37](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L37) value of `exchangeRateDenominator` is set as `immutable` and there is no `exchangeRateDenominator` variable that can be set on `InvestParams` struct*

### Impact

The calculation for the allocation limit for each round and the calculation for the total investment allocation limit will be broken.

### PoC

Change invest params with this test specs :

```solidity
VVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams({
            investmentRound: 1,
            investmentRoundLimit: 1_000_000 * 1e18,
            investmentRoundStartTimestamp: block.timestamp,
            investmentRoundEndTimestamp: block.timestamp + 1,
            paymentTokenAddress: address(PaymentTokenInstance),
            kycAddress: _kycAddress,
            kycAddressAllocation: 1_000_000 * 1e18,
            amountToInvest: 1 * 1e18,
            exchangeRateNumerator: 1e18,
            feeNumerator: _feeNumerator,
            deadline: block.timestamp + 1 hours,
            signature: bytes("placeholder")
        });
```

Add this test code in `VVVVCInvestmentLedgerUnitTests.sol` —> run `forge test —match-test testFailDAIInvest`

```solidity
 
// TestFail indicates that the function reverted because the number of conversions exceeded the allocation for that round and the total allocation for investor addresses.

function testFailDAIInvest() public {
        uint256 feeNumerator = 0; // change fee = 0 for simplicity
        
        VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature(
            sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0],
            investmentRoundSampleLimitDai,
            sampleAmountToInvestDai,
            userPaymentTokenDefaultAllocationDai,
            exchangeRateNumeratorDai,
            feeNumerator,
            sampleKycAddress,
            activeRoundStartTimestamp,
            activeRoundEndTimestamp
        );

        investAsUser(sampleUser, params);

    }
```

Result 

```solidity
