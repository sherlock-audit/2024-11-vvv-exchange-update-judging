# Missing Inclusive Deadline Check Will Cause Rejected Transactions for Users

### Summary

The missing inclusive deadline check in `_isSignatureValid` for both `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor` will cause unexpected transaction rejections for users as valid transactions made at the exact deadline timestamp will fail validation.

### Root Cause

In both contracts:

1. [VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol: 238](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L238)
The `_isSignatureValid` function uses `bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;`

This excludes transactions at block.timestamp == _params.deadline.

2. [VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol: 179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L179)
Similarly, the `_isSignatureValid` function has the same logic `bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;`


Valid transactions made at the exact deadline timestamp are rejected.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin sets deadline during signature generation to allow transactions up to a specific time.
2. A user submits a transaction with a valid signature that has `block.timestamp == _params.deadline`.


### External pre-conditions

1. A valid signature is generated off-chain for a transaction with a specific deadline.
2. The user attempts to execute their transaction close to or at the exact deadline timestamp.

### Attack Path

1. A user signs a transaction or claim with a valid deadline parameter.
2. The user submits their transaction at `block.timestamp == _params.deadline`.
3. The contract treats the transaction as expired and rejects it because of the exclusive `>` condition.
4. The user is unable to complete their transaction or claim despite meeting the expected deadline.

### Impact

For 1VVVVCInvestmentLedger`:

> Users may lose investment opportunities if their transactions are rejected unnecessarily.
> Financial impacts may arise if users fail to invest within a strict timeline.

For 1VVVVCTokenDistributor`:

> Users may lose the ability to claim their tokens if their transactions are rejected at the deadline.
> This could result in permanent loss if the deadline is critical.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `_isSignatureValid` in both contracts to use an inclusive comparison:
```solidity
bool isExpired = block.timestamp >= _params.deadline;
```
