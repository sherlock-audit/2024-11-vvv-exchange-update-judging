# Incorrect encoding of array values for EIP712 signatures.

### Summary

According to the official EIP-712 specification ([Link](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)), arrays are classified as [reference types](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#:~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20reference%20types%20are%20arrays%20and%20structs.%20Arrays%20are%20either%20fixed%20size%20or%20dynamic%20and%20denoted%20by%20Type%5Bn%5D%20or%20Type%5B%5D%20respectively.%20Structs%20are%20references%20to%20other%20structs%20by%20their%20name.%20The%20standard%20supports%20recursive%20struct%20types.). Unlike primitive types, their encoding involves a unique process. Specifically, the specification states:

> Array values are encoded as the keccak256 hash of the concatenated `encodeData` of their elements (i.e., encoding `SomeType[5]` is identical to encoding a struct with five `SomeType` members).  
> [Link](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#:~:text=The%20array%20values%20are%20encoded%20as%20the%20keccak256%20hash%20of%20the%20concatenated%20encodeData%20of%20their%20contents%20(i.e.%20the%20encoding%20of%20SomeType%5B5%5D%20is%20identical%20to%20that%20of%20a%20struct%20containing%20five%20members%20of%20type%20SomeType).)

This emphasizes that arrays should be encoded as the `keccak256` hash of their concatenated encoded elements. However, in the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::_isSignatureValid(...)` function, arrays are directly encoded, as seen below:

```solidity
function _isSignatureValid(ClaimParams memory _params) private view returns (bool) {
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
            "\x19\x01",
            DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
                    _params.kycAddress,
                    _params.projectTokenAddress,
@>                 _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,  // Incorrect encoding
@>                 _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,      // Incorrect encoding
                    _params.nonce,
                    _params.deadline
                )
            )
        )
    );

    address recoveredAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, _params.signature);

    bool isSigner = recoveredAddress == signer;
    bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;
    return isSigner && !isExpired;
}

```

This implementation conflicts with the EIP-712 specification and could cause signature verification failures.

### Root Cause

Incorrect encoding of array elements when generating the digest.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Signature verification may fail, leading to potential denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios where valid claims are rejected.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The resources linked in the PoC section provide guidance on correctly encoding arrays in accordance with EIP-712 standards.
