# Attacker will front-run and claim tokens intended for a KYC-verified user

### Summary

The vulnerability in the `claim` function allows for a front-running attack, enabling third parties to intercept and claim token transfers by copying transaction parameters from the mempool and invoking the function before the original sender. This issue arises because `msg.sender` is not included in the signature validation, allowing anyone with a valid signature to execute the call and receive the funds.

### Root Cause

`msg.sender` (the recipient of tokens) is not included in the signed data in `_isSignatureValid`, enabling any address with a valid signature to invoke the `claim` function and receive the token transfer.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `claimIsPaused` must be `false`.
- `_params.nonce` must be greater than `nonces[_params.kycAddress]`.
- The signature provided in `_params` must be valid and not expired.

### External pre-conditions

- The attacker must have access to a valid `ClaimParams` struct, including a valid signature that has not yet been used.
- The original transaction must be pending in the mempool [Eth].

### Attack Path

1. The attacker observes a pending transaction in the mempool calling the `claim` function with valid `ClaimParams`.
2. The attacker copies all parameters, including the signature, and sends their own transaction with identical parameters.
3. If the attacker's transaction is processed before the original, the tokens are transferred to the attacker's address as `msg.sender`.

### Impact

An attacker can intercept and claim tokens intended for another user, potentially resulting in the unauthorized transfer of significant funds.

### PoC

1. Monitor mempool transactions to identify pending calls to the `claim` function with valid parameters.
2. Copy the `ClaimParams` values, including the signature.
3. Submit a new transaction calling the `claim` function with identical parameters but using the attacker's address as the sender (`msg.sender`).
4. If successful, the attacker receives the token transfer, and the original transaction is rendered invalid due to `nonce` being incremented.

### Mitigation

To address the vulnerability while preserving the requirement that "any address which is an alias of a KYC address can claim tokens across multiple rounds which provide that token," consider the following mitigations:

- **Incorporate `msg.sender` into the signed data** used for `_isSignatureValid` to ensure that only the intended alias of the KYC address can successfully claim tokens. This would ensure that the signature is bound to a specific caller or set of allowed aliases.
- **Introduce a mapping or whitelist mechanism** that explicitly allows certain addresses to act as aliases for a KYC-verified user. Claims would be restricted to these addresses, reducing the risk of unauthorized claims even if a valid signature is intercepted.
