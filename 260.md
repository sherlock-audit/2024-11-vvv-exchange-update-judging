# Users can pay 0 fees while investing

### Summary

Integer division in VVVVCInvestmentLedger's fee calculation can cause a bypass of the fee mechanism as users can structure their investment amounts to result in zero fees while still investing.


### Root Cause

In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` the fee calculation can result in zero due to integer division when `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * feeNumerator` is less than `FEE_DENOMINATOR`:
```solidity
uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent =
    preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```

Instead of paying the intended fee, users can pay 0% by splitting their investments into smaller amounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. feeNumerator needs to be set to a small value (e.g., 100 for 1% fee)
2. FEE_DENOMINATOR is fixed at 10_000

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calculates the maximum amount where (`amount` * `feeNumerator`) < `FEE_DENOMINATOR`
2. For example, with `feeNumerator` = 100:
3. If `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` = 99
4. Then 99 * 100 = 9900
5. 9900 / 10000 = 0 (due to integer division)
6. Attacker makes multiple small investments just below this threshold
7. Each investment pays zero fees due to integer division
8. Attacker accumulates a significant position while paying no fees

### Impact

Users can bypass fees

### Mitigation

Modify the fee calculation to handle small amounts
