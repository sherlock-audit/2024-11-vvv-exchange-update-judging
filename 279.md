# Malicious actor can DDOS users from reaching their full allocations

### Summary

The `invest` function allows any caller to invest` _params.amountToInvest` on behalf of `_params.kycAddress` if the provided `_params` are signed by the authorized signer. However, it does not verify whether `msg.sender` is authorized to act on behalf of the specified `kycAddress`. This omission enables malicious actors to intentionally invest small amounts of tokens for other investors, thereby preventing them from reaching their maximum allocation in _one single transaction._

### Root Cause

The `invest` function first verifies that `_params` is signed by the off-chain signer:

Then, the caller transfers `_params.amountToInvest` from themselves to the contract and increases `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` of the `_params.kycAddress` by the `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`

This only happens if the `kycAddress` allocations have not reached the limit cap of the investment round:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L175-L180
```solidity
        if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```
A malicious caller can exploit these conditions by front-running investment transactions and investing an amount `X` calculated as follows:

```python
I = amount of tokens the victim is investing _params.amountToInvest
X = amount of tokens the attacker is investing
M = maximum allocation of victim in this round
P = amount of tokens victim already invested
X = M - (P + I) + 1
```

### Attack Path

1- Alice is assigned `1000` coins and decides to invest 1000 USDC to utilize her full allocation (`1:1` exchange rate for example)
2- Bob can front-run Alice's transaction by investing `X = 1000 - (0 + 1000) + 1 = 1` USDC. 
3- As a result, Alice's transaction would revert. Alice would need to choose new investment amounts, and the larger the amount she chooses, the higher the likelihood of Bob successfully front-running her transaction.

### Impact

1- The victim is not able to fulfill all their allocations in one transaction. It's possible for an attacker to easily front-run it. This creates a very bad experience for investors.
2- This creates a situation where the victim tries to invest fewer tokens than the maximum in hopes of making their transaction go through, but the attacker still front-runs it.
While it's true that the attacker is basically investing for the victim, this could create a messy situation where victims are not able to fully invest their coins and get front-run by the attacker until the round is over.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Authorize `msg.sender.` This can be done, for example, by adding an approve function that allows the kycAddress to authorize an address to invest coins on their behalf.
