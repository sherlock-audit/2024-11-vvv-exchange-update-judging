# user investment can be griefed by malicious actors

### Summary

Any malicious user can view an investParam transaction in the memPool and grief it for the user by sending only a small amount  to make sure the user transaction reverts.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

1. user should be trying to invest all their allocation or most of their allocation for the cost of the DOS attack to be reasonably small.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. a user gets an investParam offchain and submits it to the contract
2. another malicious user sees the `investParam` in the mempool and sends a little amount, to make user transaction revert for that round
3. user transaction reverts as `kycAddressAllocation` will be exceeded

### Impact

Genuine users are prevented from investing in a protocol due to malicious actors.
as this will always revert 

This is the kycAllocation restriction
