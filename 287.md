# Contracts doesn't work with Polkadot chain

### Summary

`VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` will not work with Polkadot chain

### Root Cause

VVV-Exchange supports `Eth, base, bnb, avalanche, polkadot, arbitrum` ,not only EVM.
Non And non EVM  chains can have a different address standard like Polkadot.

### Internal pre-conditions

VVV-Exchange supports Polkadot chain

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- This contract doesn't support Polkadot chain(non-EVM)
- Address datatype doesn't get support in POLKADOT chain. Address is being represented as string variable in polkadot chain.
- Due to which contracts will not work on POLKADOT chain.
- Difference between Polkadot and Ethereum chain
   - Ethereum standard is 20-bytes-long AccountId and ECDSA secp256k1 key pairs in combination with keccak256 hash function
   - Normally in Polkadot we use 32-bytes-long AccountId accompanied with Schnorrkel/Ristretto sr25519 algorithm for keys and signing, and blake2 for hashing.
- As address is represented as string datatype, the contract would fail in multiple scenario's wherever address is being used.

### Impact

Contract doesn't work on Polkadot chain

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Should make different contract with changes required like converting address to string datatype.
