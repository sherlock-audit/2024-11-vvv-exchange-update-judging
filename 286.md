# A user can invest payment token at a lower exchange rate

### Summary

A trusted off-chain centralized system handles creating the signatures and gives signature to user. User can call `invest` function until signature expires at a more favorable exchange rate.

### Root Cause

The [invest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141) function uses the stablecoin amount equivalent to the payment token exchange rate provided from off-chain centralized system (`exchangeRateNumerator`) without validation but exchange rate can be changed before signature expired.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The user has a signature with a 10-minute expiration. After 5 minutes, the exchange rate from the payment token to the stablecoin will decrease.

### Attack Path

1. After the exchange rate changed, user call invest with outdated rate.

### Impact

The stablecoin-equivalent amount will be not accurate that will allow invest for kyc address with outdated rate.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Consider using oracle to get last price for payment token in the stablecoin.
