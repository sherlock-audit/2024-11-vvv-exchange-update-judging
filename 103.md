# A later signature may DoS a previous valid signature in the VVVVVCTokenDistributor due to frontrunning or unordered usage

### Summary

VVVVVVVCTokenDistributor works as follows.
The signer issues kycAddress signatures to the output of each token. Each signature uses nonce more than the previous one.

That is, suppose the signer simultaneously issued kycAddress signatures to the output of {token1, nonce}, {token2, nonce + 1}. This is a normal situation when a user can output several tokens at once and gets several signatures for their output at once.

However, if the user uses signature {token2, nonce + 1} earlier than {token1, nonce} - this signature will become invalid due to an outdated nonce and can never be executed again - as a result, the user's funds are stuck.
```solidity
 nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce; // @audit use the same mapping for all tokens of the same user
```

### Root Cause

The main problem is that the code [updates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L124) nonce[kycAddress] to the nonce specified in the signature, not taking into account that there may be unused nonces smaller than the new one.

I.e. let's say the user's current nonce is n.
He gets two valid signatures for the output token1, token2 with nonce n + 1 and n + 2 respectively. But if token2 is output before token1, then nonces[kycAddress] = n + 2, which disables n + 1.

```solidity
if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

The user should get two signatures to withdraw different tokens (or one - but this is unlikely, it is much more likely to withdraw 2 different tokens)

Also the user must use the second signature before the first. (The user has no idea in what order these signatures were generated and is not required to understand in what order he should use them)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Also, this vulnerability can be exploited intentionally. There is nothing in the current code implementation that prevents using frontrunning to deliberately put the second signature before the first. By doing so, the attacker invalidates the first signature.

### Impact

This implementation bug allows the active signature to be invalidated. This can happen either by accident or by frontrunning)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In my opinion a much more efficient implementation would be to use mapping (bytes32 => true) which would show if the signature was used or not.
