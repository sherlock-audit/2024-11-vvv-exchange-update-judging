# User can lose their distribution due to race conditions in the `claim()` function.

### Summary

In scenarios where a user has multiple distributions from an investment, they may lose one due to unexpected events beyond their control.

For example, if the user claims their first distribution with nonce `1`, and a gas spike occurs immediately after the transaction is sent on-chain, the transaction might remain pending. If the user subsequently claims a second distribution with nonce `2`, using the current higher gas prices, the second transaction might be included in a block before the first. 

This issue arises from external factors such as using automatic gas suggestions from wallets like MetaMask or Rabby during consecutive transaction executions. When the second transaction is mined before the first, the first transaction reverts because its nonce is lower than the current nonce.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from how nonces are handled within the system, allowing a higher nonce to be used before a lower one. The vulnerability can be observed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L115-L117).

Nonces should either be stored as unique values or follow an incremental sequence, ensuring that only sequential nonces are accepted.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice has two distributions signed for her with nonce `1` and `2`.
2. Alice sends a `claim()` transaction for nonce `1`.
3. A gas price spike delays the inclusion of this transaction in a block.
4. Alice sends a `claim()` transaction for nonce `2` with a higher gas price.
5. The transaction for nonce `2` is mined before the transaction for nonce `1`.
6. The transaction for nonce `1` fails because its nonce is now outdated.

### Impact

- The user loses one of their distributions.

### Mitigation

Validate nonces using an updated mapping structure `user -> nonce -> bool`, ensuring nonce uniqueness and preventing race conditions.

```diff
    /// @notice Mapping to store a nonce for each KYC address
-   mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;
+   mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public nonces;
```

```diff
-       if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
+       if (nonces[_params.kycAddress][_params.nonce]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }
```

```diff
        // update nonce
-       nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;
+       nonces[_params.kycAddress][_params.nonce] = true;
```
