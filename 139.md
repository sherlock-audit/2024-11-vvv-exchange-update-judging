# Attacker can claim tokens meant for user

### Summary

Anyone can claim tokens on `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol::claim(ClaimParams memory)` on behalf of the `kycAddress` by sending a valid signature that claims the tokens.

### Root Cause

Valid signature for claiming tokens on `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim(ClaimParams)` can be obtained in the mempool because it is a function argument. Regular user who tries to claim tokens can be front-run by an attacker who "steals" the signature and claims tokens with the same signature.

Also, another cause of this is that tokens are transferred to `msg.sender` instead of kycAddress or another user address.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Bob (attacker) needs to be observing the mempool for the calls to `claim(ClaimParams)` on `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` contract.

### Attack Path

1. Alice (honest user) needs to call `claim(ClaimParams)` with the valid signature to claim her tokens.
2. Bob obtains the signature by seeing it in the mempool and calls the `claim(ClaimParams)` function with the exact function arguments but with the higher fee (front-run Alices transaction)

### Impact

Honest users lose their allocated tokens meant for claiming.

### PoC

Add following unit test to `VVVVCTokenDistributor.unit.t.sol` file:

```solidity
    function testClaimFrontrunning() public {
        VVVVCTokenDistributor.ClaimParams memory claimParams = generateClaimParamsWithSignature(
            sampleUser,
            projectTokenProxyWallets,
            sampleTokenAmountsToClaim
        );

        address randomAttacker = makeAddr("randomAttacker");

        vm.startPrank(randomAttacker);
        TokenDistributorInstance.claim(claimParams);
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertTrue(ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(randomAttacker) == sum(sampleTokenAmountsToClaim));
    }
```

### Mitigation

Include the address where the tokens are meant to be sent to in the signature that the "admin" signs off-chain.
