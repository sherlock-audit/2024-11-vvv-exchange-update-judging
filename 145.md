# VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol contract does not correctly follow EIP-712 when creating INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH

### Summary

In VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol contract, `amountToInvest` is not included [INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L19)   while it is included [InvestParams](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L68) struct . The omission of `amountToInvest` in hashStruct leads to manipulation of `amountToInvest` when  The [invest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141) function is invoked. The `invest()` makes a call to   `_isSignatureValid(_params)` to validate the signature provided by the user.The [_isSignatureValid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L212) function uses EIP-712 to reconstruct the signed message and verify the signature. Since `amountToInvest` is not part of the INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH, It means the signature does not validate `amountToInvest`. This means `amountToInvest` can be manipulated by the user when investing. 

### Root Cause

Omission of `amountToInvest`  in [INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L19)

### Attack Path

The user provides investment parameters, including amountToInvest=50.

1. The centralized system generates an EIP-712 digest that excludes `amountToInvest` and presents it for signing.
2. The user signs the message with their private key, producing a valid signature.
3. The user calls the `invest()` function but modifies `amountToInvest` to 1000 (or any other value that do not exceed the allocation and round limit).
4. The smart contractâ€™s `_isSignatureValid()` only checks parameters that were included in the EIP-712 signature.
5. Since `amountToInvest` was excluded, the signature validation passes, even though the signed message was for a smaller amount.


### Impact

The signed message is intended to ensure the off-chain agreement between the user and the centralized system matches the on-chain execution. However omitting `amountToInvest` in hashStruct breaks this agreement, leading inconsistent Investment data and platformFees within the system.

### Mitigation

Follow [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) specification by including `amountToInvest` in INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH
