# Users will be blocked if they claim at a later round because of nonce being set instead of incremented

### Summary

If the user decide to claim at a later stage( not in the first but for example in the third round) they will not be able to claim the amounts from the previous rounds as the nonce is being set instead of being incremented. 
```solidity
 nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;
 ```
 Here the nonce is being set, if for example the user haven't claimed in the first 3 rounds it will be set from 0 to 4 and the user will not be able to claim the amount from the previous rounds

### Root Cause

Root cause is the update of the nonce. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L124
It should be incremented. Now it is set up in a way that it is possible for the user to have locked funds in the contract.
The funds can be locked if the user doesnt claim each round but decide to claim at a further stage for example the user doesnt claim round one,two and three and decides to claim round four, they will not be able to claim the amount from the previous rounds as the nonce is updated from 0 to 4.


### Internal pre-conditions

The user should not claim the first and the second round.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

For example the user decides to claim at a later stage( at a later round) or simply forgets to claim. If such thing happens the invested amount will be locked and they will not be able to claim the money that they have invested in the previous rounds.


### Impact

Locked fund

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

They should change the update of the nonce. Make sure that the users can claim the amount that they have invested in each round even if a few rounds have already passed and they still haven't claimed.

```diff
-   nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;
+  nonces[_params.kycAddress]++
