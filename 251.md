# Protocol does not comply with EIP-712

### Summary

Protocol does not comply with EIP-712 as the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`  is not correctly calculated according to EIP 712

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L127

### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol is expected to comply with EIP-712

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- During calculation of `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` it does not account for `string version` while hashing the values.
```solidity
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                DOMAIN_TYPEHASH,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked("VVV", _environmentTag)),
                block.chainid,
                address(this)
            )
        );
```
- According to EIP 712 the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR should be calculated accordingly :
      - `string name` the user readable name of signing domain, i.e. the name of the DApp or the protocol.
      - `string version` the current major version of the signing domain. Signatures from different versions are not compatible.
      - uint256 chainId the [EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) chain id. The user-agent should refuse signing if it does 
        not match the currently active chain.
      - `address verifyingContract` the address of the contract that will verify the signature. The user-agent may do contract specific 
        phishing prevention.
      - `bytes32 salt` an disambiguating salt for the protocol. This can be used as a domain separator of last resort.        
- But during the calculation version is not used for calculating the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR  and salt as well is not used.  
      

### Impact

This error leads to an incompatibility with the EIP-712 standard. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Use `string version` as well while calculating the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR
