# Missing nonce in allows signature replay

### Summary

Within the function `_isSignatureValid` there isn't a nonce increment check which allows attackers to perform replay attack griefing previous investment before the deadline.

### Root Cause

Within the function `_isSignatureValid` there isn't a nonce increment check.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1) The signer signs a message that does not include a nonce.
2) The signature is intercepted and copied by an attacker from the previous transaction.
3) The attacker is then able to re-use this signature to re-send the transaction setting the original signer investment to 0, griefing investment.


### Impact

 A griefer/attacker can perform replay attack with previous kyc address's investment and set it to 0, since this is the Invest is the main function it does break the core functionaility

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a incrementing nonce everytime `Invest` function is called.
