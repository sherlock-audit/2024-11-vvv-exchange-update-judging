# Uncontrolled Token Destination allows for front-running Attacks

### Summary

The `claim()` function transfers tokens from the _params.projectTokenProxyWallets to `msg.sender` without any validation that `msg.sender` is an authorized address.
Anyone who obtains the signature can front-run the intended recipient and steal the tokens.

### Vulnerability Detail
The core vulnerability is the lack of destination address validation in the `claim()` function. This allows anyone with a valid signature to claim the tokens, regardless of whether they are the intended recipient.

The vulnerability occurs in the claim() function, specifically in this code block:

        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller (msg.sender)
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender, // The attacker's address
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
        
The issue is that the function transfers the tokens directly to msg.sender without any validation that msg.sender is the intended recipient. This allows an attacker who has obtained a valid signature to front-run the intended recipient and receive the tokens instead.

### Tool used

Manual Review


### pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to obtain a valid signature for the `ClaimParams` struct.
2. The attacker's address needs to be used as the destination `msg.sender` in the claim() function call.

To obtain the valid signature, the attacker could Intercept the original transaction containing the signed `ClaimParams`.

Once the attacker has the valid signature, they can call the claim() function with their own address as the destination to receive the tokens, front-running the intended recipient.


### Attack Path

Original intended flow:
            KYC Address -> Gets Signature -> Submits Claim -> Receives Tokens
Attack flow:
            KYC Address -> Gets Signature -> [Attacker Front-runs] -> Attacker Receives Tokens

### Impact

Complete loss of claimed tokens for the original intended recipient.
The original KYC address can no longer claim the tokens (nonce used).
No way to recover the stolen tokens.

### Mitigation

1. Alias Registry:
    Maintain an on-chain registry of authorized aliases.
    This provides more flexibility but requires additional setup.

2. Signed Destination:
   Include the destination address in the signature.
   This maintains flexibility without extra storage.
   Requires a change to the signature format.
