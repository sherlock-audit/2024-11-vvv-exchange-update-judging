# Inclusion of signature Field in Struct Breaks EIP-712 Compliance

### Summary

The contract's EIP-712 implementation improperly includes the signature field as part of the struct definition. However, the signature is neither hashed nor included in the data being signed off-chain, creating a mismatch between the struct representation used off-chain (during signing) and on-chain (during verification). This discrepancy violates the strict encoding rules of EIP-712 and renders the implementation non-compliant.

For reference, see the [EIP-712 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), specifically under the Definition of encodeData:

```
The encoding of a struct instance is enc(value₁) ‖ enc(value₂) ‖ … ‖ enc(valueₙ), i.e., the concatenation of the encoded member values in the order that they appear in the type. Each encoded member value is exactly 32 bytes long.
```

This rule implies that all members of the struct data structure must be encoded sequentially, which in this case would incorrectly include the signature field if it is part of the struct
