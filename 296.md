# Dynamic Exchange Rate Handling without Proper Validation

### Summary

The dynamic handling of `exchangeRateNumerator` fetched from an off-chain service could cause [incorrect investment calculations] for [users] as [attackers] can [manipulate the off-chain service or use an unvalidated exchange rate].

### Root Cause

The dynamic handling of `exchangeRateNumerator` fetched from an off-chain service could cause [incorrect investment calculations] for [users] as [attackers] can [manipulate the off-chain service or use an unvalidated exchange rate].

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `exchangeRateNumerator` is fetched from an external off-chain service without proper validation or verification on-chain.

### External pre-conditions

1. The off-chain service providing the `exchangeRateNumerator` could be manipulated, leading to invalid or incorrect exchange rates.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker manipulates the off-chain service or directly provides manipulated `exchangeRateNumerator`.
2. The manipulated value is used in the `invest()` function to calculate the investment amount.
3. This results in incorrect amounts being invested, potentially benefiting the attacker.

### Impact

The users suffer from incorrect investment amounts, which could lead to financial loss or unfair advantage. The protocol suffers from manipulation of exchange rates, undermining trust in the investment system.

### PoC

```solidity
// Example of a manipulated exchange rate being provided
address attacker = 0x1234...; // Attacker's address
uint256 manipulatedRate = 1; // Example of manipulated exchange rate

// Attacker calls invest with manipulated rate
contract.invest({
    amountToInvest: 1000,
    exchangeRateNumerator: manipulatedRate,
    kycAddress: 0xSomeValidAddress,
    feeNumerator: 50
});
```

### Mitigation

 Implement on-chain validation of the exchangeRateNumerator fetched from the off-chain service before using it for investment calculations.
Use a trusted oracle or other mechanism to ensure the integrity of the exchange rate data
