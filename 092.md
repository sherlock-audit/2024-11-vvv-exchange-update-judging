# Immutable Signer Key Creates Single Point of Failure

### Summary

The signer address being set in the constructor without any update mechanism will cause a permanent loss of functionality for users as any compromise or loss of the signer's private key will render the contract unusable, requiring a full redeployment.

### Root Cause

The choice to set the signer address as immutable in the constructor without an update mechanism is a mistake as it creates a single point of failure that cannot be remediated without redeploying the entire contract.

In [`VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L117-L123) and [`VVVVCTokenDistributor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L84-L89), the signer is set in the constructor without any function to update it:

[VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L117-L123](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L117-L123)
```solidity
    constructor(
        address _signer,
        string memory _environmentTag,
        address _authorizationRegistryAddress,
        uint256 _exchangeRateDenominator
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {
        signer = _signer;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract is deployed with a signer address
2. Contract is not upgradeable

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker gains access to the signer's private key through compromise
2. Attacker can now sign malicious investment parameters or token claims
3. Alternatively, if the signer's private key is lost, no new valid signatures can be generated

### Impact

The protocol and its users suffer complete loss of functionality as:
- If key is compromised: Attacker can authorize unlimited malicious investments/claims
- If key is lost: No new valid signatures can be generated, making the contract unusable
