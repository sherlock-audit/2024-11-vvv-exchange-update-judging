# Missing Inclusion of `amountToInvest` in Signature Verification Allows Investment Manipulation

### Summary

The exclusion of `amountToInvest` from the signed message verification in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` introduces a potential risk where attackers can manipulate the investment amount. While the contract enforces `investmentRoundLimit` and `kycAddressAllocation`, the missing inclusion of `amountToInvest` in the signed data allows attackers to make investments that may not align with user intent or manipulate fee calculations.

### Root Cause

In [VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol: 212](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L212) the `_isSignatureValid` function does not include the `amountToInvest` parameter when validating signatures. This omission allows attackers to alter the investment amount without invalidating the signature.

Sponser said that: 

> Limits Are Enforced: The contract enforces `investmentRoundLimit` and `kycAddressAllocation` to ensure that no investment exceeds signed limits.

However, the exclusion of `amountToInvest` still opens the contract to potential misuse, including mismatched user intent, fee manipulation, and deviation from best practices.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin sets signer to a valid address.
2. Investments are not paused (`investmentIsPaused` is `false`).

### External pre-conditions

1. Off-chain signer generates a signature without including `amountToInvest`.
2. An attacker gains access to the signature (e.g., through phishing or reuse).

### Attack Path

1. The off-chain signer generates and shares a valid signature for an investment.
2. An attacker intercepts or reuses the signature and manipulates the `amountToInvest` parameter.
3. The `_isSignatureValid` function validates the signature despite the manipulated `amountToInvest`.
4. The attacker submits a manipulated transaction, bypassing user intent or fee calculations.


### Impact

1. Fee Manipulation: Fees are calculated based on `amountToInvest`. Manipulating this value can result in underpayment or overpayment of fees, impacting contract revenue or user costs.
2. User Intent Misalignment: A legitimate user may generate a signature intending to invest a specific amount. An attacker can alter the `amountToInvest`, resulting in unintended investments.
3. Best Practices Violation: Excluding a critical parameter like `amountToInvest` from the signature deviates from security best practices and undermines the integrity of the investment process.
4. Compliance Risks: While the sponsor assumes users will not manipulate the system, external incentives or malicious actors could exploit this gap.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include the `amountToInvest` parameter in the signed message by updating the `INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH` and the `_isSignatureValid` function to validate this value.
