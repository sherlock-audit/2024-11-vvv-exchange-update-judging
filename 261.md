# Attackers can repeatedly withdraw KYC tokens through replay attacks

### Summary

The lack of unique management of nonce in the claim method of the VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol contract will lead to replay attacks, causing losses to KYC users, because attackers can reuse intercepted valid signatures to claim tokens multiple times.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106

In VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol:113, the validation logic for nonce was not strict enough and only checked whether the nonce was greater than the stored value. This could result in old signatures and nonces being reused without being effectively invalidated.

### Internal pre-conditions

KYC users need to generate a valid signature with the correct parameters (such as nonce, deadline, etc.).
The contract's nonce storage allows the nonce to be larger than the current stored value, but there is no mandatory match or one-time invalidation of the signature.

### External pre-conditions

The user, that is, the attacker, replays the signature multiple times, or the attacker obtains the user's valid signature and replays it multiple times.

### Attack Path

The KYC user or attacker generates legitimate ClaimParams data and signs it.
The attacker obtains the user's signature.
The attacker repeatedly calls the claim() function and submits the same signature and parameters.
The contract does not strictly check the nonce, allowing the signature to take effect, thereby issuing tokens to the attacker multiple times.

### Impact

Project owners may lose funds due to duplicate distribution of tokens.
Attackers obtain duplicate tokens that should not belong to them.

### PoC

// The attacker repeatedly calls the claim() method

for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    distributor.claim(params);  // Repeatedly submit the same signature and parameters
}


### Mitigation

Make sure nonce must exactly match nonces[_params.kycAddress] + 1 to prevent non-incremental nonce from taking effect.
Use a hash value to mark whether the signature has been used to prevent the reuse of signatures.
