# Users can claim more tokens than their investment amount due to lack of on-chain accounting

### Summary

The lack of on-chain accounting in `VVVVCTokenDistributor` will allow users to claim more tokens than their investment amount as the contract only validates signatures and nonces without tracking total claimed amounts against total investments.

### Root Cause

In `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol`, the `claim` function only validates the signature and nonce without checking:
- Total amount claimed by user
- User's total investment amount
- Relationship between claims and investments

While `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` tracks investments through `investmentRecords` and `stableEquivalentInvested`, the claim function has no connection to these records.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has invested some amount (e.g., 1000 USDC)
2. User obtains multiple valid signatures with different nonces for different claim amounts
3. Sum of claim amounts exceeds user's total investment

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol lacks on-chain protection against over-claiming as:
- Users can execute multiple valid claims that exceed their investment
- Each claim with a higher nonce will succeed
- No cumulative tracking of claimed amounts
- No validation against original investment
