# Reentrancy Risk Evaluation and Mitigation for VVV VC Investment Ledger

### Summary

The primary vulnerability in the VVV VC Investment Ledger contract arises from the state updates being executed before the external IERC20.safeTransferFrom call. This exposes the contract to reentrancy attacks, where a malicious token contract could invoke the invest function again before the state changes are committed, leading to double-counting of investments. In such an attack, the same investment could be recorded multiple times.
So the user can reentrancy following code and stored several times kycAddressInvestedPerRound and kycAddressInvestedPerRound.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L183
```solidity
        kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.kycAddress][
            _params.investmentRound
        ] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
        kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
@=>    IERC20(_params.paymentTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _params.amountToInvest
        );
```

### Root Cause
The part located between line 183 and line 186 has to move under IERC20 function.


### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker invests malicious tokens.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attacker invests and inside fallback or receive function calls invests again.
### Impact

The user can get twice effects with one invests.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The following codes have to move under IERC20()function.

```solidity
 IERC20(_params.paymentTokenAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _params.amountToInvest
        );
@=>    kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.kycAddress][
            _params.investmentRound
        ] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
        totalInvestedPerRound[_params.investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
```
