# Denial of Service in Multi-Round Token Claim Function

### Summary

A lack of error handling in the `claim` function will cause a complete failure of token claims for all users as any malicious or misconfigured wallet in the projectTokenProxyWallets array will cause a transaction revert.

[VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L130)

### Root Cause

In [VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L130), the safeTransferFrom function within a loop does not account for failures, and a single failed transfer will revert the entire transaction. This lack of error handling makes the function vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. At least one address in the projectTokenProxyWallets array is misconfigured or malicious.
2. The misconfigured wallet has insufficient balance or allowance to process the transfer.
3. Admin has authorized these wallets for token transfers without proper validation.


### External pre-conditions

1.  A malicious wallet contract is deployed to revert on safeTransferFrom.
2. The token used for claims behaves unexpectedly, e.g., has a fee-on-transfer mechanism or a failing transferFrom implementation.

### Attack Path

1. The admin authorizes a misconfigured or malicious wallet in the projectTokenProxyWallets array.
2. A legitimate user calls `claim` to claim tokens.
3. The safeTransferFrom call for the malicious or misconfigured wallet reverts, causing the entire claim transaction to fail.

### Impact

-Disruption to Token Distribution: Legitimate claimants are unable to receive their tokens due to failures in unrelated wallets or malicious behavior.
-Service Downtime: Administrators may need to manually resolve wallet configuration issues, leading to delays in token distribution.
-Reputation Damage: Users may lose trust in the system due to perceived instability or unfairness.


### PoC

A misconfigured wallet contract that always reverts on safeTransferFrom:

> // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MaliciousWallet {
    function transferFrom(
        address,
        address,
        uint256
    ) external pure returns (bool) {
        require(false, "Revert to cause DoS");
        return true;
    }
}

Simulate the `claim` function using this wallet in the projectTokenProxyWallets array.


### Mitigation

Continue Execution on Transfer Failure:
Modify the loop to handle transfer failures gracefully. Use a try/catch block to catch errors and skip the failed transfer instead of reverting the entire transaction.
>for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
    try projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
        msg.sender,
        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
    ) {
        // Transfer successful
    } catch {
        // Log the failure and continue
        emit TransferFailed(
            _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
            _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
        );
    }
}
