# Overflow in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` line-165 due to unchecked large value of product entities will cause `invest()` to revert.

### Summary

In function `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol::invest()` there could be case of overflow due to following code line -

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L165

```js
  uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /exchangeRateDenominator;
```
If the value of `_params.amountToInvest` and `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` is very large or even on of the value is very large, it will lead to overflow of uint256 and execution will revert.

### Root Cause

large value of `_params.amountToInvest` and `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` isn't checked in `invest()` of `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `signer` signes a investment transactions which has pretty high amountToInvest and exchangeRateNumerator values, such that amountToInvest*exchangeRateNumerator > max(uint256).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

It will cause the `invest()` function to revert for a particular signed InvestParams every time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check the values of `_params.amountToInvest` and `_params.exchangeRateNumerator` if they are too large or not.
