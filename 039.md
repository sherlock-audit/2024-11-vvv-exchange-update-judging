# Overcoming Investment Limits and Exceeding Allocation in VC Ledger

### Summary

The contract allows users to invest in a VC project, with investment limits imposed per user and per round. However, there is a vulnerability that enables an admin to bypass these limits. While individual users are restricted by their allocated investment amounts and the total round investment limit, the admin function addInvestmentRecords does not enforce these checks. This allows the admin to add investment records that exceed the established limits for both individual users and the total round, potentially leading to over-investment and a violation of intended financial constraints.
Also, it makes others not invest because the the total invest amount is full.
There is limitation in invest function.

```solidity
 if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```
But there is no limitation in addInvestmentRecords function.

### Root Cause

Inside addInvestmentRecords function, in line 267, the limitation has to exist.
```solidity
 if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```
### Internal pre-conditions

The user invests by invests function until approximately limitation and also invests via addInvestmentRecords fuction.
It can over the limitation.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The user can invest via invest function until limitaion.
And invest via addInvestmentRecords function.

### Impact

The admin can artificially inflate the total investments in a round, allowing users to invest beyond the prescribed limits. This could lead to an imbalance in the investment pool, impacting the distribution of funds and potentially making the project unfair to other investors.
If the admin adds investment records without checking the individual userâ€™s allocation, it could cause a user to exceed their allowed investment. This would violate the principle of ensuring that no single user gets preferential treatment.
And the attacker can invest the large amount so it makes the others can not invest because the round total limitation may be full.
So it makes the system fault.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure Admin Follows Limits: When the admin calls addInvestmentRecords, ensure that the admin is also subject to the same investment limits as users. This can be achieved by adding checks within the addInvestmentRecords function to verify that the total amount invested by the admin does not exceed the investment round limits or individual KYC address allocations.
