# Malicious users can steal rewards by front running claim transaction of innocent users.


### Summary

Malicious users can steal rewards intended of legitimate users by front running the victim claim transaction in the mempool and  submitting the victim's signed transaction data with parameters before the victim's transaction is executed.

>Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
 
> Eth, base, bnb, avalanche, polkadot, arbitrum

this issue only works for chain which has a public mempool like: ETH , BSC and Avalanche 
### Root Cause

`VVVVCTokenDistributor:claim` , there is no check to prevent front running of claim function.

[VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106-L121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106-L121)

```solidity
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        if (claimIsPaused) {
            revert ClaimIsPaused();
        }


        if (_params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length != _params.tokenAmountsToClaim.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }


        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }


        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        } 
```
### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user initiates a claim request off-chain and provides the required parameters to the signer.
2. The authorized signer signs the claim with valid parameters, creating a signed transaction.
3. The signed transaction becomes visible in the mempool before being executed.
4. A malicious user monitors the mempool, extracts the signed data, and deploys a contract to call claim function  with the same signed parameters and  higher gas fees .
5. The malicious user's transaction is mined first, allowing them to steal their rewards before the legitimate user's transaction is processed.

### Impact

loss of rewards for legitimate users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. add a check where only user who requested claim can call the function or 
2. change msg.sender to user who requested the claim which doesnt prevent from front-running issues but even if its front ran the rewards are still sent to the user who  requested claim.
