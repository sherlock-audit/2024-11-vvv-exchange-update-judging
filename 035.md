# Signature replayability may cause inaccurate exchange rate usages

### Summary

Signature replayability may cause inaccurate exchange rate usages

### Root Cause

In [VVVVCInvestmentLedger Contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L175C1-L180C10), investment's worth is calculated by using the parameters of the signature.

Investment's worth may change in time and this time is limited by the signature's deadline. In price fluctuations, this deadline can cause losses which is acceptable risk in here but if the signature is already used, using the same signature is not avoided in current codebase and it can be used many times until the deadline which can cause more losses for the protocol. Because the signature approve the caller to invest with certain exchange rate for specified time. In order to protect the protocol, user should get another signature with updated exchange rate from the trusted-system.

```solidity
        // the stablecoin amount equivalent to the payment token amount supplied at the current exchange rate
        uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
            exchangeRateDenominator;
```


### External pre-conditions

1. Price fluctuations on the token prices

### Attack Path

1. User gets a signature for investment with 1.5 rate ( each token 1.5 USDT worth ) for 1 minute
2. User invests using this signature with 1.5 rate in 10 seconds
3. The token price is dropped to 1.3 after 10 seconds
4. User uses the same signature again and again, invests with 1.5 rate which will cause unfair share investment between users and loss of funds for the protocol

### Impact

Medium - In certain scenarios, it will cause loss of funds for the protocol because users can invest with same signature and outdated exchange rate.

### Mitigation

In order to protect the protocol, user should get another signature with updated exchange rate from the trusted-system.
