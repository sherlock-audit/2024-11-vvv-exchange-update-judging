# Excessive Gas Consumption (Block Gas Limit DoS)

### Summary

The lack of a limit on the number of wallets and token amounts processed in a single transaction can cause excessive gas consumption, making the `claim()`  unusable for other users as the transaction exceeds the block gas limit.

### Root Cause

In the `claim()` , the loop processing `projectTokenProxyWallets` and `tokenAmountsToClaim` arrays does not enforce a maximum length. This allows attackers to craft transactions with excessively long arrays that consume too much gas.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
	projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
		_params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
		msg.sender,
		_params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
	);
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The Ethereum network has a block gas limit that restricts the amount of computation or storage a block can handle.

### Attack Path

 1. Bob (the attacker) constructs `_params` with an excessively large number of `projectTokenProxyWallets` and `tokenAmountsToClaim`.
2. Bob Calls `claim()` submits the malicious transaction.
3. The loop in the `claim()` function consumes so much gas that the transaction cannot be processed within the block gas limit.
4. Bob's transaction fails but blocks other valid transactions in the same block.
5. Repeated attacks can prevent legitimate users from using the `claim()` function.


### Impact

This can disrupt the protocol by making the `claim()` function unusable for all users. Repeated attacks can block legitimate transactions, causing frustration and delays.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Enforce a maximum size for `projectTokenProxyWallets` and `tokenAmountsToClaim` in the `claim()` function.
