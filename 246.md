# price of invest isn't correctly set making loss of funds to either the user the protocol

### Summary

In `invest` function we multiply the value of `amountToInvest` with `exchangeRateNumerator` to get the `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` which is the value saved to the user after taking fees 

note that: 
`* @param exchangeRateNumerator The numerator of the conversion of payment token to stablecoin (i.e. VVV to USDC)`

which is the conversion rate now this is set off-chain and not taken from a real time oracle this leads to incorrect amount for the `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` 

### Root Cause

lag between on-chain execution and the value set off-chain.

### Internal pre-conditions

user want to invest and call invest function.

### External pre-conditions

price is different from the rate set off-chain during the on-chain execution.

### Attack Path

1. User want to invest 10 USDC while the value of the `exchangeRateNumerator` is 1.2
2. the call get executed on-chain while the price of USDC is 0.996 USD.(in some cases could be at a depegged price ex: USDC=0.7 USD)
3. user could use the difference in price and buys at a law price then invest 

### Impact
there is a difference between price for the users investing on-chain and off-chain which isn't fair, this could cause loss of funds for the project that gets on-chain investment.

### Mitigation

Handle such case by using an oracle and retrieve an accurate price to update the right `exchangeRateNumerator`
