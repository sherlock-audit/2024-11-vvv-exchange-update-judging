# If allowance by a project's proxy wallets run out or is 0 before `VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim()`, it allows anyone to reuse the signature.

### Summary

The `claim()` in [VVVCTokenDistributor.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106). lets a user associated with the KYC wallet claim his share of tokens. The function ensure the parameters and signature are valid but does not check if a project's wallets approved the transfer of tokens. The  `safeTransfeFrom()` used in [Line 131](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L131) will revert if the platform does not have enough or run out of allowance to make the transfer. This could leads to the signature being used by a malicious actor as soon as the project's wallet approve the platform before the user could claim.  

### Root Cause

The `claim()` should check for approval to ensure the function does not fail unexpectedly.

### Internal pre-conditions

The off-chain system generates parameters for the function call.

### External pre-conditions

A project's wallet has not yet approved the protocol to transfer its tokens or the allowance runs out from other users' claiming.
A user must claim before approval or with insufficient allowance.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The failure of transactions after ensuring the signature is valid, will let malicious actors who are watching the transactions claim the token's before the user.

### PoC

Lets say Bob is allowed to claim 100 tokens from a project's wallets.

One of the wallets fail to approve the platform or run out of allowance from other user's claiming, before Bob claims with the function `claim()` and it reverts.

When the wallet approve the protocol, a malicious attacker who sees both the transactions could claim before Bob.

When Bob tries to claim, the function will reverts as the nonce is incremented.

### Mitigation

Add checks of approval from the wallets in the function.
