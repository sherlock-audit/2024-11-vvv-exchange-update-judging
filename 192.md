# Users can surpass the `totalInvestedPerRound` and invest more than thier all caps combined

### Summary

Users can front-run system updates to increase their `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` beyond their caps and `totalInvestedPerRound` above all `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` combined, breaking a core invariant. Stopping other other users from fully investing their `kycAddressAllocation` amounts.

Example:
1. Users pay the stable coin value in fiat using the front-end
2. Front end calls [addInvestmentRecords](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256-L277)
3. The user front-runs the function and calls `invest` to invest his max cap
4. `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` is surpassed, now `totalInvestedPerRound` will be reach with some users still having `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` left unfilled. 

**These users will not be able to reach their max `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` as `totalInvestedPerRound` will be fully maxed out.**


### Root Cause

Users front-running admins who change contract parameters

### Internal pre-conditions

- none

### External pre-conditions

Admin to call `addInvestmentRecords`

### Attack Path
- Cap is 10k
- Total up to now is 8k

1. Admin calls `addInvestmentRecords` to increase the records by 1k for Alice, who has invested 0
2. Alice FR him and call `invest` to invest 1k and reach her max cap
3. The admin investment will surpass Alice `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` (1k) and sets it to 2k
4. `totalInvestedPerRound` is now 10k - his max
5. Bob tries to invest, his `kycAddressAllocation` is 1k, but since `totalInvestedPerRound` is reached he is not able to invest

### Impact
Some users will not be able to invest in this round
Other users will surpass their max `kycAddressAllocation`

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add this if to prevent the amounts exceeding user's max cap.

```diff
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;

+           if(kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] > kycAddressAllocation) {
+               kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] = kycAddressAllocation;
+           }
+           if(totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] > investmentRoundLimit) {
+               totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] = investmentRoundLimit;
+           }

            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
        }
```
