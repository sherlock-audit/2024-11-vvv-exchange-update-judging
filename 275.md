# `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor` doesn't support non-evm polkadot chain

### Summary

- `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor` are supposed to support different chains, not only EVM. And these chains can have a different address standard like Polkadot.
-  In polkadot there is no data type of address, instead of that it is string data type. That means `kycAddress` which is address data type for EVM chian should be string data type for polkadot.
- That means every address in this contract will not work on polkadot chain like `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` cannot be set.

### Root Cause

- For polkadot chain address data type cannot work and it has to be string data type.
