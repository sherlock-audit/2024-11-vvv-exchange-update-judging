# Attacker can front run VVVVCTokenDistributor's Claim function

### Summary

VVVVCTokenDistributor allows to distribute tokens to investors.
The correct distribution amounts are determined offchain, an admin controlled "signer" signs the transaction, and another admin controlled wallet executes.
The claim function then sends tokens to msg.sender, which then can further distribute these to the correct owners.

The protocol team intents to deploy this contract to ETH mainnet, which allows for frontrunning.
This will lead to attackers scanning the mempool for this transaction, frontrunning it, and claiming tokens which do not belong to them.  

### Root Cause

The rootcause of this issue is sending tokens to msg.sender and not a trusted address / the kyced address.
```solidity
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to sign a transaction to distribute tokens to someone
2. Submit this signature on ETH mainnet

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker sees the signature in mempool
2. Copys signature and frontruns admin  

Please keep in mind: even if this is unlikely, a malicious RPC provider might do this as well. There are several scenarios where the transaction can be "leaked" before mined and included into the blockchain. 

### Impact

Loss of funds for VC.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There are several ways this issue can be mitigated:
1. Access control for claim function
2. Send tokens to KYCed Address instead of msg.sender
3. Send tokens to admin wallet
