# Investment Limits is Bypassable

### Summary

The `invest` function can be exploited to bypass investment limits by front-running the `addInvestmentRecords` function. A user can repeatedly call `invest` within the same block, effectively exceeding the limits set by the protocol.

---

### Root Cause

- invest could be called multiple times with the same signature

- The `addInvestmentRecords` function does not validate against the `kycAddressAllocation` or `investmentRoundLimit` parameters. This oversight allows malicious users to exploit the system.


`* @param kycAddressAllocation The maximum amount an address can invest after KYC verification.`
`* @param investmentRoundLimit The total investment limit for the round.`

---

### Internal Preconditions

- The user invests part of their funds through an off-chain process.

---

### External Preconditions

- The admin calls `addInvestmentRecords` to register the user's investment.

---

### Attack path

1. Assume the `kycAddressAllocation` is 10,000.
2. The user invests 4,000 off-chain.
3. user monitor the mempool and see the admin preparing to call `addInvestmentRecords` for 4,000.
4. The user front-runs the admin by calling `invest` twice for another 2 of 4,000 in the same block.
5. Both the user's and admin's transactions succeed, recording a total of 12,000 exceeding the 10,000 limit.

This pattern can be repeated with varying amounts to exploit the system further.

---

### Impact

- **Core Contract Vulnerability**: The investment limits (`kycAddressAllocation` and `investmentRoundLimit`) can be bypassed, undermining the protocol's functionality and intended controls.
- **Loss of Trust**: Investors may lose confidence in the protocol due to unfair advantages and lack of proper safeguards.
- **Unfair Advantage**: Malicious users gain an unfair edge over compliant investors, leading to reputational damage and potential financial loss for the protocol.

---

### Mitigation

Implement a robust validation mechanism in the `addInvestmentRecords` function to ensure compliance with the `kycAddressAllocation` and `investmentRoundLimit` parameters. This check should prevent any transactions that would exceed the specified limits, regardless of the user's actions.
