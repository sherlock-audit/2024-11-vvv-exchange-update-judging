# Replay attack in case of hard fork for both contracts in scope

### Summary
Note that the chainId for DOMAIN_SEPARATOR is calculated once in the [constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L127) and cannot be changed afterwards.
```solidity
constructor(
...
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {

        // EIP-712 domain separator
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                DOMAIN_TYPEHASH,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked("VVV", _environmentTag)),
                block.chainid,
                address(this)
            )
        );
    }
```
If there is ever a hardfork for any chain in scope - the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR will become invalid and be the same for both chains (main and forked). Malicious user can use signature from one chain for another chain.

### Root Cause

no update mechanism for chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.

This problem is particularly noticeable for the `Distributor' contract as it will allow an attacker to get money on two versions of the network.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Fork of any chain in scope

### Attack Path

1. Network fork occurs
2. User uses a signature from one network for transactions on both networks.

### Impact

Like other errors of this type, this error deserves severity: medium.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use [EIP712 from Open Zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol), or use the approach that uses this contract when calculating DOMAIN_SEPARATOR
```solidity
    function _domainSeparatorV4() internal view returns (bytes32) {
        if (address(this) == _cachedThis && block.chainid == _cachedChainId) {
            return _cachedDomainSeparator;
        } else {
            return _buildDomainSeparator();
        }
    }
```
