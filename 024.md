# A malicious user can exceed his max allocation for a investment round

### Summary

The `addInvestmentRecords()` function lack enforcement validation that opens a frontrunning edge case, where a malicious user can push his allocated amount far over the limit.

### Root Cause
Looking at the `Invest()` function we can see that the investment limit is heavly checked with the following IF-statement:
```solidity 
        // check if kyc address has already invested the max stablecoin-equivalent amount for this round,
        // or if the total invested for this round has reached the limit
        if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```
So far all good, but when looking at the admin `addInvestmentRecords()` function we can see that the admin can arbitrarly add investment records to mimic the `invest()` function (Maybe for off-chain payments, ...etc, etc), but it lacks the same above check at enforces that a "KYC address" investment cannot go over it's limit. This open an edge case where a malicious user that aquired a valid signature and opting to also invest through off-chain process, finally the admin would just enter his allocation through `addInvestmentRecords`. The user then will frontrun the admin call by calling `invest` first with his valid signature, when his tx is pass, admin's call would also pass and add new amounts to the KYC address thus leading to the malicious user being allowed to allocate twice and exceeding his personal (and round aswell!) limit.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

- Admin will manually set investment records through `addInvestmentRecords`

### Attack Path

**Assume:** 
- Malicious investor Alice, with a allowed investment limit of 5000 USDC.
- Honest investor Bob, with the same allowed investment limit of 5000 USDC.
- Admin, will manually allocate Alice's 5000 USDC amount (e.g payment purposes, ...etc).

**Example:**
1. Alice get's a signature for calling `invest`, willing to invest her whole allowed limit, but she won't use signature now for the attack.
2. For wathever reason (mostly due to payment method), admin will manually set Alice's investment through `addInvestmentRecords` function.
3. Alice frontrun admin's call by calling the `invest()` with the valid signature before and allocating her 5000 USDC
4. Then after Alice tx, admin's `addInvestmentRecords` call will add the same amount (5000 USDC - Alice paid off-chain) and  would also pass but due to a lack of check Alice's investment is now 10000 USDC, 2x over the limit.
5. Bob last investor, calls `invest()` with his 5000 USDC, but his tx revert because due to Alice double allocation the `totalInvestedPerRound` would be full.         

### Impact

- Last investor will have no allocation slot left
- Malicious investor will have a unfair allocation amount (over the allowed limit) compared to other investors, thus leading to have greater chuck of the participation.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Implement a similar check at ` addInvestmentRecords()` to mitigate this attack:
```solidity
        if (
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.kycAddressAllocation - kycAddressInvestedThisRound ||
            postFeeStableAmountEquivalent > _params.investmentRoundLimit - totalInvestedThisRound
        ) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
```
