# Attacker can claim innocent users' tokens by frontrunning their transaction

### Summary

The missing check in `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` will cause a loss of funds for users as an attacker can frontrun their `claim(...)` transaction.

### Root Cause

In `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` there is a missing check that should verify that `msg.sender` is actually `_params.kycAddress`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Innocent user's `claim(...)` transaction is pending in the mempool

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker frontruns innocent user's transaction by calling the same function with the same arguments and gets his tokens
2. Innocent user's transaction reverts as nonce is now invalid

### Impact

The attacker can steal the innocent users' tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add this check to `claim(...)`:
```diff
function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        //...
+       require(msg.sender == _params..kycAddress, "caller is not the kyc address");
        //...
}
```
