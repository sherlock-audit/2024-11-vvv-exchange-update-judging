# Malicious User Exploits Timing to Double-Count Investments Before Admin Executes addInvestmentRecords()

### Summary

A front-running attack can occur when a malicious user exploits the timing between an admin's manual investment record addition and a userâ€™s investment. 
The user who the admin is going to add record calls the invest() function before the admin executes addInvestmentRecords(), allowing the user's investment to be double-counted. This manipulation enables the user to exceed investment limits, bypass allocation restrictions, and disrupt the fairness of the investment process.

```solidity
       kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.kycAddress][
            _params.investmentRound
        ] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
        totalInvestedPerRound[_params.investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
```

```solidity
     kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
```

### Root Cause

Inside invest function, line 183 and inside addInvestmentRecords function, line 273 have both store operation.

### Internal pre-conditions

The user has to invest before the admin is going to execute addInvestmentRecords function with user's.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
By addInvestmentRecords function, the user is going to invest, he front runs the invest function.

### Impact

The user can register his invest with double effects.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that the admin must always call invest() before calling addInvestmentRecords().
 This guarantees that the admin's investment is processed first and locked in, and prevents a malicious user from investing before the admin's record is added.
