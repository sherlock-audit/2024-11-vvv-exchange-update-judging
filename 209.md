# Decimal Mismatch in Investment Calculations Leading to Token Value Misrepresentation

### Summary
The `invest` function assumes that all tokens used for investment (such as USDC and DAI) have the same number of decimals (e.g., 18 decimals). However, tokens like USDC have 6 decimals, and the calculation for the stablecoin equivalent of the invested amount may not be accurate when the decimals are not standardized. This can lead to incorrect amounts being calculated, potentially resulting in incorrect allocation limits, round limits, or fees.

### Root Cause

The function [invest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L165-L171) assumes that all tokens involved in calculations have consistent decimal precision (implicitly, 18 decimals).
```solidity
 function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
 //...

 // the stablecoin amount equivalent to the payment token amount supplied at the current exchange rate
        uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
            exchangeRateDenominator;

        // the post-fee stableAmountEquivalent, to contribute toward user and round limits
        uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent -
            (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;

//... 

 }
```
However, there is no adjustment or normalization for token decimals before or after this calculation. This implies that the function assumes the `amountToInvest` and derived values (like `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` and `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent`) are compatible regardless of the underlying token's decimal format.

If these values are used in further calculations (e.g., enforcing investment limits, allocating rewards, or tracking total investments), the protocol fails to handle them consistently, leading to potential under- or over-allocation errors.

The protocol works under the assumption that all tokens are directly comparable in their raw form, which is only true if all tokens use the same decimal standard. Tokens with differing decimal formats (e.g., USDC with 6 decimals vs. DAI with 18 decimals) break this assumption.

### Impact

- The stablecoin equivalent calculated for the investment will be inconsistent when used in comparisons with tokens of different decimal formats., which may cause over- or under-allocation of funds.
- The post-fee amount could be incorrectly calculated for non-18-decimal tokens.
- The round limit appears underutilized, potentially leading to over-allocation errors.


### PoC

#### USDC Calculations:
- _params.amountToInvest = 1,000,000,000 (1,000 USDC, with 6 decimals)
- _params.feeNumerator = 1,000
- exchangeRateNumerator = 1,000,000
- exchangeRateDenominator = 1,000,000
- FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10,000

    1. **Pre-Fee Stable Amount Equivalent**:
   
       `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator`

        Substituting values:

        `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (1,000,000,000 * 1,000,000) / 1,000,000` 

         = 1,000,000,000

    2. **Post-Fee Stable Amount Equivalent**:
        
        `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR`

       Substituting values:
       
       `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = 1,000,000,000 - (1,000,000,000 * 1,000) / 10,000` 

        = 900,000,000

Since there is no explicit handling of token decimals, USDC's value is drastically undervalued because the function treats it as if it has 18 decimals, even though it only has 6 decimals.

#### DAI Calculations:
- _params.amountToInvest = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1,000 DAI, with 18 decimals)
- _params.feeNumerator = 1,000
- exchangeRateNumerator = 1,000,000
- exchangeRateDenominator = 1,000,000
- FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10,000

    1. **Pre-Fee Stable Amount Equivalent**:
    
        `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) / exchangeRateDenominator`

       Substituting values:

        `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 * 1,000,000) / 1,000,000` 

         = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

     2. **Post-Fee Stable Amount Equivalent**:

         `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR`

         Substituting values:

          `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 - (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 * 1,000) / 10,000`
     
           = 900,000,000,000,000,000,000

The function calculates DAI correctly since it's already in 18 decimals.

### Mitigation

```diff
+ import {IERC20Metadata} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol";

 function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
 //...

 

         // the stablecoin amount equivalent to the payment token amount supplied at the current exchange rate
-        uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
-            exchangeRateDenominator;

+       uint256 normalizedAmountToInvest = _params.amountToInvest * (10 ** (18 - IERC20Metadata(_params.paymentTokenAddress).decimals()));

+       uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (normalizedAmountToInvest  * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
+            exchangeRateDenominator;


         // the post-fee stableAmountEquivalent, to contribute toward user and round limits
         uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = preFeeStableAmountEquivalent -
            (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;

//... 

 }
