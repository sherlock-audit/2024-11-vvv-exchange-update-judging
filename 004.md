# Users can enter with an unfair payment token price since signatures cannot be revoked.

### Summary

When users are provided signatures, they're ultimately given the exchange rate at which the protocol will accept the payment token.

```solidity
        uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
            exchangeRateDenominator;
``` 

Then, up until the signature's deadline or the round's `investmentRoundEndTimestamp` comes, the user can `invest`.

In case the payment token's price drops significantly or even crashes, since signatures cannot be revoked,  the user will be able to `invest` with a significantly overpriced valuation of their payment token.

### Root Cause
Signatures cannot be revoked

### Attack Path

1. User is provided signature to invest with a stablecoin valued at $1. 
2. Said stablecoin depegs and goes to $0.50
3. User can now invest with their deppeged stablecoin at valuation of $1.
4. Signer has no way of preventing this.

### Impact

Investing at an unfair valuation of assets
