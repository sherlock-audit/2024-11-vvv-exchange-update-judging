# Users May Be Unable to Claim Indefinitely in Certain Scenarios

### Summary

KYC addresses utilize nonces to prevent replay attacks. However, this nonce verification mechanism exposes the contract to potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.



### Root Cause

The current nonce for a KYC address must be significantly greater than the previous nonce. If the nonce becomes large enough to approach 2^256 , it will not pass the verification check, leading to potential issues at [line 115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L115).

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The contract is vulnerable to DoS attacks, which may prevent users from claiming indefinitely.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a nonce space limit to ensure proper validation. The following code snippet should be included:
```solidity
if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress] || _params.nonce - nonces[_params.kycAddress] > noncespacelimit) {
    revert InvalidNonce();
}
```
