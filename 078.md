# Hard fork chain ID handling in EIP-712 domain separator is not updatable, leading to signature reuse across forked chains

### Summary

Static chain ID in domain separator construction will cause signature reuse for VVV protocol users as an attacker can replay signatures on forked chains where the original signatures were signed with the pre fork chain ID.


### Root Cause

In both VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol and VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol, the chain ID is immutably stored in the domain separator during construction:
```solidity
constructor(address _signer, string memory _environmentTag, address _authorizationRegistryAddress) {
    // ... 
    DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
        abi.encode(
            DOMAIN_TYPEHASH,
            keccak256(abi.encodePacked("VVV", _environmentTag)),
            block.chainid,  // Immutably stored at deployment
            address(this)
        )
    );
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User creates valid signature on original chain (e.g., Ethereum mainnet)
2. Chain undergoes hard fork, creating new chain with different chain ID
3. Attacker can replay the original signature on forked chain because `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` still contains old chain ID
4. Both chains will accept the same signature as valid

### Impact

Users of VVV protocol suffer from signature replay attacks across forked chains, leading to:

- Double-spending of claims across chains
- Unauthorized investments on forked chains
- Loss of funds if tokens exist on both chains post-fork

### Mitigation

Make `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` dynamic by computing it on each use or implement `chainID` check
