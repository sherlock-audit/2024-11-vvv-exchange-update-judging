# Blacklistable Token Vulnerability in `claim` Function Prevents Token Claims

### Summary

The `claim` function fails when interacting with blacklistable tokens like USDC or USDT. If any wallet in `_params.projectTokenProxyWallets` is blacklisted, the `safeTransferFrom` call reverts, causing the entire claim transaction to fail. This prevents users from claiming tokens and disrupts protocol functionality.

### Root Cause

### Reference
[Code Link for `claim` Function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106)  
The function directly uses `safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens from `_params.projectTokenProxyWallets` to the claimant. For tokens like USDC or USDT that enforce blacklisting, any transfer involving a blacklisted address will revert. The lack of handling for such failures causes the entire claim process to fail, even if other wallets and transfers are valid.
### Relevant Code
```solidity  
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {  
    projectToken.safeTransferFrom(  
        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],  
        msg.sender,  
        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]  
    );  
}  
```

### Attack Path



### **Scenario**  
1. A user initiates a claim for tokens where `_params.projectTokenAddress` corresponds to a blacklistable token like USDC.  
2. One or more wallets in `_params.projectTokenProxyWallets` have been blacklisted by USDCâ€™s token contract.  
3. When the `safeTransferFrom` function is executed for a blacklisted wallet, the token contract reverts the transaction.  
4. The entire claim transaction fails, preventing the user from claiming any tokens, even if other wallets are valid.  


### Impact

The `claim` function of the contract is vulnerable to failures when handling blacklistable tokens like USDC or USDT. If any wallet in `_params.projectTokenProxyWallets` is blacklisted by the token contract, the `safeTransferFrom` call will revert, causing the entire claim transaction to fail. This renders the protocol unusable for affected users, as they are unable to claim their tokens.  

Additionally, this vulnerability could lead to situations where legitimate claimants are blocked due to external token contract logic, adversely affecting user trust and protocol functionality.  

### PoC

### Mitigation


## Implement a Pull-Based Claim Model:
   - Instead of directly transferring tokens from proxy wallets to the claimant, transfer tokens to the protocol contract first.  
   - Allow users to withdraw their tokens from the protocol contract, ensuring that failures in one transfer do not block the entire claim process.
