# The investments that are being processed for the time being aren't paused, even if the setInvestmentIsPaused function is called.

### Summary

If a admin calls `setInvestmentIsPaused` to pause investments and then immediately calls `invest` in a new transaction, the `invest` function will check the state of  `investmentIsPaused` at the time it is executed. If the state was changed to  true  before the `invest` call was executed, the investment will be paused. However, if the `invest` call is executed before the state change takes effect, it will proceed.
Also, If  `setInvestmentIsPaused` is called in a separate transaction after an `invest` call has already been initiated, it will not affect that ongoing transaction.

### Root Cause

In case it weakens the admin's authority. The admin must be able to pause all investments, even if they are currently being processed.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The `invest` function is called.
2. The `setInvestmentIsPaused` function is called before the `invest` function has finished, but after the `investmentIsPaused` condition is passed.

The investment that is being processed wasn't paused.

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Duplicate `if (investmentIsPaused) revert InvestmentPaused();` line on [(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L143)] to the end of `revert` function.
2. Or use re-entrency modifier for `invest` function and  `setInvestmentIsPaused` function.
