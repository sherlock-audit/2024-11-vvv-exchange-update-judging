# Attacker will perform unauthorized duplicate claims depleting project wallets

### Summary

The improper nonce management in `VVVVCTokenDistributor` will cause unauthorized duplicate claims for KYC addresses as an attacker will reuse valid signatures with incremented nonces to claim tokens multiple times.

### Root Cause

In [VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol: 115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L115), the nonce mechanism only checks whether the provided nonce is greater than the stored nonce:

```solidity
if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
    revert InvalidNonce();
}
```

This logic allows an attacker to increment the nonce and reuse the same signature to bypass replay protection. The contract does not ensure that the signature corresponds to the specific nonce being used, nor does it track previously used nonces.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The off-chain signer generates a valid signature for a transaction with a specific nonce (N).
2. The nonce for the KYC address (`_params.kycAddress`) is less than N in the contract's nonces mapping.

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker has access to a valid signature for the KYC address.
2. The attacker submits claims with incrementally increased nonces while reusing the same signature.


### Attack Path

1. The attacker observes a valid signature for a KYC address (`_params.kycAddress`) with a nonce N and other claim parameters.
2. The attacker uses the same signature but increments the nonce to N+1, N+2, and so on.
3. The contract validates the new nonce (since N+1 > N) and processes the claim.
4. This process is repeated with incremented nonces, depleting the project's token reserves.

### Impact

Affected Party: Project wallets and legitimate users
Loss: The project wallet suffers a complete depletion of tokens intended for legitimate users. The attacker gains the claimed tokens from the project wallet.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Include Nonce in the Signed Data: Update the `CLAIM_TYPEHASH` to include the nonce in the signed message:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant CLAIM_TYPEHASH =
    keccak256(
        "ClaimParams(address kycAddress,address projectTokenAddress,address[] projectTokenProxyWallets,uint256[] tokenAmountsToClaim,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"
    );
```
2. Track Used Nonces: Implement a mapping to store all used nonces for each KYC address:

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public usedNonces;

if (usedNonces[_params.kycAddress][_params.nonce]) {
    revert InvalidNonce();
}

usedNonces[_params.kycAddress][_params.nonce] = true;
```
3. Remove the Existing Nonce Logic: Replace the current nonce logic to ensure every nonce is used only once, regardless of its relation to the highest nonce.
