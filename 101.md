# Investment limits can be bypassed because of dual entry points, i.e in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` and in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()`

### Summary

`VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` contains two separate functions([`VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141-L205) and [`VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256-L277)) that modify the same investment tracking state variables. While `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` implements proper investment limit checks, `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()` lacks these validations, allowing bypassing of investment limits.


### Root Cause

Inconsistent validation between two functions that modify the same state variables, i.e [`kycAddressInvestedPerRound`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L40) and [`totalInvestedPerRound`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L43). The admin function `addInvestmentRecords()` was likely added as a convenience function but failed to implement the same security checks as the main `invest()` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

`investmentIsPaused` must be false.

### External pre-conditions

- An account must have already invested through `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()`

### Attack Path

1. A user invests maximum allowed amount through `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()`
2. An admin calls `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()` for the same user/round
3. Investment limits are bypassed as `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()` doesn't check:
    - `kycAddressAllocation` limits
    - `investmentRoundLimit`
    - round activity period


### Impact

- Investment limits can be bypassed


### Mitigation

Add the same limit checks to `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()`

```solidity
    /**
        @notice Allows admin to add multiple investment records to the ledger
        @dev does not account for a nominal payment token / exchange rate - only modifies stablecoin equivalent invested
     */
    function addInvestmentRecords(
        address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
        uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
        uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (
            _kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length ||
            _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length
        ) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            // get current invested amounts
            uint256 currentInvested = kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_kycAddresses[i]][_investmentRounds[i]];
            uint256 totalInvested = totalInvestedPerRound[_investmentRounds[i]];
            
+            // add check limits
+            if (_amountsToInvest[i] > _kycAllocations[i] - currentInvested ||
+            _amountsToInvest[i] > _roundLimits[i] - totalInvested) {
+            revert ExceedsAllocation();
+           }
           
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
        }
    }
