# VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim function doesn't authorize msg.sender resulting in theft of tokens by front-running

### Summary

The `claim` function correctly verifies that the `ClaimParams` are signed by the designated signer. However, it does not verify that `msg.sender` is authorized to execute the claim with the provided `ClaimParams`. This omission allows anyone to front-run a claim and steal the tokens.

### Root Cause

The claim function first verifies that `_params` is signed by the off-chain signer:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L119-L121
```solidity
        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }
```
Then, it iterates over `_params.projectTokenProxyWallets` and transfers `_params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]` from each proxy wallet to `msg.sender`:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```
There are no checks in the code to ensure that `msg.sender` is authorized to receive these tokens. In fact, anyone can front-run this function and easily steal the tokens as long as correct `_params` are provided

### Internal pre-conditions

- `claimIsPaused` must be `false`

### External pre-conditions

- calls to `claim` must go through a public mempool

### Attack Path

- Alice decides to claim her 100 tokens of A, B, C
- Alice calls the claim function with correct pre-signed `_params`
- Bob sees the alice transaction in the mempool and front-runs it by passing same `_params`
- Bob receives all the 100 coins of A, B, C tokens
- Alice transaction reverts

### Impact

No one will be able to claim their tokens as all of them will be front-runned

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Authorize `msg.sender` This can be done, for example, by adding an approve function that allows the kycAddress to authorize an address to claim coins on their behalf.
