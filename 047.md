# The contract does not strictly adhere to EIP-712.

### Summary

The contract does not account for changes in the chainId when constructing the DOMAIN_TYPEHASH.
This does not comply with the proposal description:
"uint256 chainId the EIP-155 chain id. The user-agent should refuse signing if it does not match the currently active chain."

The INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH and CLAIM_TYPEHASH do not fully define the data types of the structures, as their corresponding structures also include a signature.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When the chain.id changes, the DOMAIN_TYPEHASH remains in its original state, which could lead to signature replay attacks.
An invalid TYPE_HASH according to EIP-712 may lead to visualization failure.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Check if the chainId has changed every time the DOMAIN_TYPEHASH is retrieved. If it has changed, rebuild it.
2. Remove the signature field from the structure so that its TYPEHASH can correspond to the structure's fields.
