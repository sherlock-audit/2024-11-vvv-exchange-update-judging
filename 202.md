# DOS Issue in Token Distribution

## Summary
If one of the addresses in `projectTokenProxyWallets` has not approved enough tokens or is blacklisted, the user's claim transaction will revert during the `transferFrom` call, preventing them from claiming any tokens they are entitled to.

permalink on the loop issue : [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L129-L136)

## Root Cause
The `claim()` function processes token transfers in a single transaction using a loop that must complete successfully for all wallets. If any transfer fails, the entire transaction reverts, preventing users from claiming any tokens.

## Internal pre-conditions
- The contract must be unpaused (`claimIsPaused == false`)
- A valid signature from the authorized signer
- Valid nonce and deadline

## External pre-conditions
- At least one address in `projectTokenProxyWallets` is blacklisted or unable to transfer tokens
- The token contract implements blacklisting functionality (common in USDC, USDT, etc.) which are in scope for this audit

## Impact
**Severity: Medium**
- Lack of tokens access
- Signature DOS
- Affects core functionality of the contract
- Lost of potential win for users

## Mitigation
Implement one of the following solutions:

1. Allow partial claims by handling failed transfers gracefully:

```solidity
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        // ... existing validation ...
        
        uint256 successfulClaims = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            try projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            ) {
                successfulClaims++;
            } catch {
                // handle the address that failed to transfer
                // to allow the user to recall the transferFrom later
                continue;
            }
        }
    }
```

2. Split claims into individual transactions

3. emit an event with wrong `projectTokenProxyWallets` and forge a new signature with the same nonce
