# Malicious user may front run a user's claim to steal their funds.

### Summary

Lack of access control allows a malicious user to steal another's signature via frontrun in order to steal their claim.

### Root Cause

in VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol ln 106
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106
```solidity
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        if (claimIsPaused) {
            revert ClaimIsPaused();
        }

        if (_params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length != _params.tokenAmountsToClaim.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

        // define token to transfer
        IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);

        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }
```
The function `claim` does validation to ensure the signature is valid and that claims are not paused. In the for loop the code sends the erc20 tokens to the msg.sender. This allows anyone to steal another user's `_params` and signature in order to steal their claim. Since the msg.sender is never validated, as long as the signature is valid, a malicious user can frontrun to steal the claim.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. user must have a valid signature and claim

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. alice has a claim and has received the valid signature from the signer.
2. alice submits her tx to the blockchain
3. bob sees her tx and steals her param data and signature
4. bob frontruns alice tx in order to steal her claim.
5. alice can no longer claim her righful tokens because the nonce was set and therefore her signature will not work.

### Impact

Theft of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement some sort of msg.sender authentication to ensure the correct msg.sender is claiming.
