# Using a Single Signer Could Result in Loss of funds and System Disruption

### Summary

Both contracts in scope relies on a single `signer` address for critical functions such as  validating all claims/investments or pausing claims/investments etc. However this is a very risky method. Because If the private key for the signer address is exposed (e.g., via phishing, malware, or insider threats), the attacker gains full control of the contracts . This is not an unlikely case. In crypto world there are many similar cases: Here are some examples that leads to huge amounts to be stolen:

### Root Cause

Using single `signer` address [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L28) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L31) 

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

A compromised signer address

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A single `signer` mechanism could lead to catastrophic losses for  both users and platforms. Considering the potential results and these types of incidents have occurred multiple times in the crypto space(see above), Ä± think medium severity is appropriate. 

### PoC

### Mitigation

I suggest you to replace the single `signer` address with a multi-signature wallet.
