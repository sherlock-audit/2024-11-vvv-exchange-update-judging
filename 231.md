# One user can DoS the claim() function

### Summary

In the smartcontract `VVVVCTokenDistributor`, the function `claim()` will revert if one of the address has a problem (blacklisted or ask for hasn't approved enough tokens) and as you can see the `safeTransferFrom()` is in a loop so it will revert all the transactions.

[claim() function link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L102-L145)

### Root Cause

The `claim()` function will transfer all the tokens in the same transaction, if one of the transfer revert, the transaction reverts and all the transfer revert also.

It means that an user will have to get an other approve signature to claim his tokens and hope that in the next transaction, every address won't have a problem.

### External pre-conditions

1. Minimum one address has a problem and can't receive.

### Impact

**Medium**
- Lack of token access
- Signature DOS
- The function doesn't work how it has to be
- Possibility to loose funds

### Mitigation

You can split claims address per address.
