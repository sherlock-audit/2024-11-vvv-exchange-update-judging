# Attackers Can Claim Funds Meant for KYC-Verified Users by Exploiting Missing `msg.sender` Verification

### Summary

The missing verification of `msg.sender` against the `kycAddress` in `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` will cause unauthorized token claims for legitimate users as an attacker will use a stolen or leaked signature to impersonate the `kycAddress` and execute the functions.

### Root Cause

In [VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim: 106](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106), the absence of a verification step to ensure that `msg.sender` matches the `kycAddress` allows unauthorized users to act on behalf of the verified address.

Similarly in [VVVVCInvestmentLedger.invest: 141](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141), but sponser confirmed that:

> we're not trying to restrict investment to only KYC addresses, because in the end only a controller of a KYC'd address should claim tokens after investing

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An attacker must obtain a valid signature for a legitimate `kycAddress`.
2. Admin needs to deploy the contracts without adding a `msg.sender` verification check.


### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to acquire the signature through phishing, keylogging, or interception.
2. A user must generate and provide valid input parameters for the signature, which can be reused by the attacker.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker obtains a valid signature for the `kycAddress`.
2. The attacker calls `VVVVCTokenDistributor:claim()` using their own `msg.sender` address but the valid signature for another `kycAddress`.

The contract process the transfer tokens to the attacker's address in the case of `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol`.


### Impact

`VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol`: An attacker can claim funds meant for a legitimate user, causing a complete loss of funds for that user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `msg.sender` verification step to ensure that the caller is the verified `kycAddress`.

 `VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim()`

```solidity
// Inside the claim function
function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
    if (claimIsPaused) {
        revert ClaimIsPaused();
    }

    if (_params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length != _params.tokenAmountsToClaim.length) {
        revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
    }

    if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
        revert InvalidNonce();
    }

    if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
        revert InvalidSignature();
    }

    // Add this check
    if (msg.sender != _params.kycAddress) {  <<<@
        revert UnauthorizedCaller();
    }

    // Update nonce
    nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

    // Rest of the function...
}

// Define the new error
error UnauthorizedCaller();
