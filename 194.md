# Wrong InvestmentRecords are added to the ledger

### Summary

The admin can add investment records to a ledger by calling the `addInvestementRecords` function with the *kycaddresses,investmentRound and amountToInvest*. The `amountToInvest` value is wrong since it does not account for fees deducted making it add more amount to the ledger than the actual invested amount.

There is also a discrepancy between the actual amount invested and the amount added to the ledger whereby on investing the `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` is recorded as shown below.
```solidity
        kycAddressInvestedPerRound[_params.kycAddress][
            _params.investmentRound
        ] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
        totalInvestedPerRound[_params.investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;

```
while on adding investment Record to the ledger `amountToInvest` is added including the deducted fee as shown below
```solidity
           kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
     
```

### Root Cause

In `addInvestmentRecords` wrong amount is added to the ledger

### Internal pre-conditions

Fee Value should be a positive value

### External pre-conditions

Admin adding investment records to a ledger

### Attack Path

1. Bob wants to invest 100USDC
2. Project deducts 10USDC as fee
3. Bobs' `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` == 90USDC
4. Admin wants to add Bobs' records to the ledger. He now adds bob with an amount of 100USDC instead of 90USDC because deducted fees is not part of the invested amount

### Impact

Wrong Amounts will be added to the ledger than the invested amount.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `postFeeStableAmountEquivalent` to investment records instead of amountToInvest

```diff
    function addInvestmentRecords(
        address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
        uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
-        uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
+        uint256[] calldata _postFeeStableAmountsEquivalent

    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (
            _kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length ||
            _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length
        ) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
-            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];
+            uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent = _postFeeStableAmountsEquivalent[i];
-            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
+            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;
-            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
+            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += postFeeStableAmountEquivalent;

-            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
+            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, postFeeStableAmountEquivalent);

        }
    }

```
