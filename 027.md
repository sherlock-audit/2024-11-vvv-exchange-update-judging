# `VVVVCInvestmentLedger._isSignatureValid()` function uses incorrect typeshash when verifying the `InvestParams` struct.

### Summary

The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.invest()` function calls the `_isSignatureValid()` function to verify signatures for the `InvestParams` struct. However, the type hash for `InvestParams` is incorrectly defined in the `INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH`, as it lacks the `uint256 amountToInvest` field. This causes issues with EIP-712 compliant signature verification, potentially leading to failed signature validation.

### Root Cause

- The issue arises due to a missing field in the type hash definition for `InvestParams` in the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contract.
Here is the definition of the [InvestParams](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L60-L73) struct:
```solidity
    struct InvestParams {
        uint256 investmentRound;
        uint256 investmentRoundLimit;
        uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp;
        uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp;
        address paymentTokenAddress;
        address kycAddress;
        uint256 kycAddressAllocation;
@>      uint256 amountToInvest;
        uint256 exchangeRateNumerator;
        uint256 feeNumerator;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature;
    }
```
However, the type hash [INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L19-L24) used to hash this struct does not include the `uint256 amountToInvest` field:
```solidity
    bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            bytes(
@>              "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
            )
        );
```

### Impact

Due to wrong type hash computation leading to wrong digest validation, verifying signatures might fail.
Breaking the EIP-712 mentioned in [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/README.md).


### PoC

Attempting to verify a signature for `InvestParams` that includes the `uint256 amountToInvest` field will result in a failed verification, since the hash used in `_isSignatureValid()` does not account for this field.

### Mitigation

Add the `uint256 amountToInvest` field into the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH` as follows.
```solidity
    bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(
            bytes(
--              "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
++              "InvestParams(uint256 investmentRound,uint256 investmentRoundLimit,uint256 investmentRoundStartTimestamp,uint256 investmentRoundEndTimestamp,address paymentTokenAddress,address kycAddress,uint256 kycAddressAllocation,uint256 amountToInvest,uint256 exchangeRateNumerator,uint256 feeNumerator,uint256 deadline)"
            )
        );
```
