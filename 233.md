# `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor` are susceptible to signature replay attacks in the case of a hard fork

### Summary

The EIP712 `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is build only once in the constructor of both contracts and in the case of a hard fork, all signed permits from the original chain can be replayed on the forked chain.

### Root Cause

We can see in both contracts that the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is immutable and therefore built only once - on contract deployment. This means that we are writing the chainId only once to the separator and in case of a hard fork, when it is changed on the fork network, our `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` will remain the same and allow us to replay signatures.

Check the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L96
and `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L131

If you check the OZ's EIP712 implementation you will see that the Domain Separator is built again, in case it changes, with the new chain id. (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol#L80-L86)

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

A hard fork

### Attack Path

The off-chain system signs a `ClaimParams` struct for a KYC address on the Ethereum mainnet. In case of a hard fork this signature becomes replayable since the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` doesn't change its chain id.

### Impact

A signature replay attack on the forked chain means that any signed permit given to an address on one of the chains can be re-used on the other. This means that in case of the claim permission, a KYC address can claim his rewards twice - first on the original chain and then on the forked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the OZ's EIP712 implementation to see how they handled that - https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol#L80-L86.
Just build the domain separator if `block.chainId` changed.
