# Malicious actor can frontrun `VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim()` and claims rewards for himself

### Summary

Malicious actor can frontrun `VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim()` and claims rewards for himself.

### Root Cause

`VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim()` function doesn't verify that the claimant of the reward is the one who is entitled to receive it, which opens the door for any malicious actor to frontrun the txn and claim/steal the rewards of the actual/entitled claimant.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `VVVVCTokenDistributor.claim()` function is supposed to allow any address which is an alias of a KYC address to claim tokens across multiple rounds that provides the claimed token if they have invested in the protocol (checked off-chain).

- So the claimant calls [`claim(ClaimParams memory _params)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L130C8-L136C10), where `_params` has all the keys/details of the claim that are going to be verified before sending rewards to the entitled claimant, and this verification is done by checking that the `params.signature` is a valid one:

```javascript
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
      //...
      //...
        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        //...
           for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

        //...
    }
```

where:

```javascript
function _isSignatureValid(ClaimParams memory _params) private view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
                        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
                        _params.nonce,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
                )
            )
        );

        address recoveredAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, _params.signature);

        bool isSigner = recoveredAddress == signer;
        bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;
        return isSigner && !isExpired;
    }
```

- After the verification is done, the **`msg.sender` that is supposed to be the entitled claimant** receives the rewards/distribution tokens.

- **But** as can be noticed, the function supposes that the legit claimant is the `msg.sender` of the txn, but since there's **no check made on the caller being the legit claimant**; then the txn can be frontrun by any malicious actor providing the same `_params` and claiming/stealing the rewards from the legit claimant.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A legit claimant calls `claim()` with valid `_params`.
2. A malicious user frontruns the transaction and calls `claim()` with that valid `_params`.
3. the rewards will be distributed/sent to the malcious user (call sender), stealing the legit claimant rewards.

### Impact


The legit claimant token distribution/rewards will be stolen.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Update the `ClaimParams` struct to have another key for the legit claimant, and update `_isSignatureValid()` to include the `claimant` in the digest and check that the `msg.sender` is the legit claimant, so that only entitled users/claimant can claim.
