# Non-alias address of kycAddress can also call the `invest()` and `claim()` functions

### Summary

The protocol is supposed to allow only the aliases of kycAddress to call the `claim()` function but there is not checking for it any the `claim()` function can be called by any address.

### Root Cause

Not including alias address in the digest and signature and no checks to check if the `msg.sender` is aliases or not

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Signer signed for the user to claim rewards

### External pre-conditions

1. User uses another non-alias address to claim the rewards

### Attack Path

1. The protocol expects only the aliases of kycAddress to call the `claim()` function
2. user get the signatur and params using alias address
3. user then call the `claim()` function with another non-alias address

### Impact

Breaks the protocol integrity as it expects an alias address of kycAddress to claim the rewards but any non-alias address can also claim the reward

```javascript
    /**
@>   * @notice Allows any address which is an alias of a KYC address to claim tokens across multiple rounds which provide that token
     */
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        .
        .
        .
    }

    function _isSignatureValid(ClaimParams memory _params) private view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        CLAIM_TYPEHASH,
                        _params.kycAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenAddress,
                        _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
                        _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
                        _params.nonce,
                        _params.deadline
                    )
                )
            )
        );

        address recoveredAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, _params.signature);

        bool isSigner = recoveredAddress == signer;
        bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;
        return isSigner && !isExpired;
    }
```

No checks for aliases as well as there no aliases address in the signature and digest.

### Mitigation

Include alias address for kycAddress in digest and signature
