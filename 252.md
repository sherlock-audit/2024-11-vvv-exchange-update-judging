# User could bypass the limits of investments by frontrunning `addInvestmentRecords`

### Summary

`invest` could be called multiple times with the same signature knowing this a user front-run `addInvestmentRecords` calling invest multiple times in the same block that the admin function exceeds the limits.

### Root Cause

`addInvestmentRecords` doesn't check `kycAddressAllocation` nor `investmentRoundLimit`

### Internal Pre-conditions

User invest part of his funds off-chain

### External pre-conditions

admin adds the user investment records with `addInvestmentRecords`

### Attack path

- ex: `kycAddressAllocation` = 100. 
- user add invest with the off-chain system 100 .
- user watch the mempool waiting for the admin to sign the investment records.
- user frontrun the the admin calling the `invest` with 100.
- no invest will sign the user record as it bypass the limits.
- also the admin call to `addInvestmentRecords` will succed recording 200.
- while the max is 100 a user bypassed this limit


another example 
- user add invest with the off-chain system 50.
- user watch the mempool waiting for the admin to call `addInvestmentRecords` with 50.
- user frontrun the function and call `invest` in the same block with  50.
- the 2 calls will pass as they didn't exceed the limit with value 100.
- the admin adds another 50 with total recorded 150 which is above the limit.

any values could be applied which achieve the bypassing of the limits

### Impact

broken core contract functionality, as the limits could be bypassed, also give loss of trust to the protocol, and not a fair for investors.


### Mitigation

Add a validation on the admin function `addInvestmentRecords` for `kycAddressAllocation` and `investmentRoundLimit`
