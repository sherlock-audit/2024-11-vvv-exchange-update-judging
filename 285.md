# Immutable  exchangeRateDenominator will require redeployment for different stablecoins

### Summary

A Immutable exchangeRateDenominator will require redeployment in case the contract intents to support different stable coins.

In case for example VVV wants to allow investors to pay with USDC and DAI, they will need to deploy 2 contracts which does not seem intent by the protocol team.

### Root Cause

Hardcoding the exchangeRateDenominator will require redeployment of contracts in case used with different stablecoins.
`exchangeRateDenominator = _exchangeRateDenominator;`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin set exchangeRateDenominator to 1e6 (to support USDC)
2. Now project wants to offer payments in DAI
3. exchangeRateDenominator scales the amount invested incorrectly (to large)

### Impact

The preFeeStableAmountEquivalent will be calculated incorrectly, leading to wrong state in contract and eventually broken core functionality.  

### Mitigation

Include the exchangeRateDenominator inside of params, or remove it completely and calc offchain.
