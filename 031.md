# A zero investment amount can lead to a DOS (Denial of Service) attack

### Summary

Due to the lack of a minimum investment amount requirement, attackers can make a large number of malicious investments with a zero investment amount, consuming the investment round's time and preventing other users from making legitimate investments.

### Root Cause

Vulnerable Code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L143-L156
here is no check for the minimum investment amount here; The check only verifies if the basic requirements are met.

### Internal pre-conditions

The investment meets some basic requirements, as follows:
```solidity
if (investmentIsPaused) revert InvestmentPaused();

        // check if signature is valid
        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // check if the investment round is active
        if (
            block.timestamp < _params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp ||
            block.timestamp > _params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp
        ) {
            revert InactiveInvestmentRound();
        }
```
This allows attackers to send a large number of zero-amount investments, causing other users' investment requests to experience prolonged delaysï¼ŒMiss the investment round

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The attacker first calls the invest function, sending a large number of zero-amount investment requests. The contract can only slowly process the attacker's requests, consuming the time allocated for the investment round.

### Impact

Possible consequences:

- DOS (Denial of Service) attack
- High gas consumption
- Excessive array iteration: Due to the length limitation of the investor address array, this can cause the administrator to take an excessive amount of time to add investment records.
```solidity
  function addInvestmentRecords(
        address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
        uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
        uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
     //...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];
//...
}
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

You can take the following measures:

- Set a minimum investment amount
- Modify the investment address array to have a fixed length
- Add a check to ensure the investment amount is not zero, as follows:
```solidity
  if (investmentIsPaused) revert InvestmentPaused();

        // check if signature is valid
        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // check if the investment round is active
        if (
            block.timestamp < _params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp ||
            block.timestamp > _params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp
        ) {
            revert InactiveInvestmentRound();
        }

       //check if the _params.amountToInvest isn't 0
     if( 
         _params.amountToInvest == 0
       ){
         revert()
         }
```
