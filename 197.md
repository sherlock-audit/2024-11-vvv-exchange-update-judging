# Project does not handle Fee On Transfer Token correctly

### Summary

According to the [readme.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/README.md) the project is intended to use specific token such as USDC for investment. USDC does not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future. In such case the investAmount received by the project will be less than the recorded value because it does not account for fees supported by such token.

### Root Cause

Project not accounting for fees on transfer tokens

### Internal pre-conditions

Fee on transfer token is being invested

### External pre-conditions

User investing using the fee on transfer token

### Attack Path

1. Alice wants to invest 200USDC
2. On transfer token transfer fee of 2USDC will be deducted
3. Project Will record 3 200USDC as received amount even though received amount is 198USDC

### Impact

Project will receive less amount than amount recorded on investing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add logic to account for such tokens
