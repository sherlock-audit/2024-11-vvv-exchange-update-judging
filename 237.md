# Attacker can front-run claim transactions and steal KYC-ed users' reward

### Summary

When claiming tokens a KYC address has to provide a valid signature to the `ClaimParams` struct so he can claim his rewards, the problem is that if an attacker front-runs this transaction, he can claim the rewards, because these rewards are sent to `msg.sender` instead of the KYC address.

### Root Cause

In [`VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L133) we can see that the tokens are sent directly to `msg.sender`, however the function never checks if `msg.sender` is actually the KYC address. Therefore an attacker can check the mempool for the signature and then front-run the transaction by providing higher gas. When attacker's transaction is executed first he will be able to claim the tokens.

!NOTE that this can be executed on chains that have a public mempool (Like ETH as specified in the ReadMe).

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A KYC user receives a claim signature from the off-chain system.
2. He submits his `claim` transaction to the blockchain
3. While this transaction is in the mempool, an attacker sees it and immediately sends the same `claim` transaction, providing more gas so that his transaction is executed first
4. The attacker's claim transaction is executed, the signature is validated and since `msg.sender` is the attacker he receives the tokens
5. When the KYC user's transaction goes through it will revert because that nonce has already been used by the attacker

### Impact

Theft of rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either send the tokens directly to the `_params.kycAddress` or make sure that `msg.sender == _params.kycAddress`
