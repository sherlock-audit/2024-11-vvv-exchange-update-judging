# Price Oracle Absence in VVVVCInvestmentLedger Creates Arbitrage Window

### Summary

The `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` contract relies on off-chain signed exchange rates that remain static during the signature validity window, creating potential arbitrage opportunities during significant price movements of the payment token.

### Root Cause

The exchange rate mechanism in `invest()` uses a fixed `exchangeRateNumerator` that's signed off-chain and remains valid until the deadline:

```solidity
uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
    exchangeRateDenominator;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Valid investment parameters signed by authorized signer
- Investment round is active
- User has sufficient payment tokens

### External Pre-conditions

- Significant price movement of payment token occurs between signature issuance and execution
- Market conditions allow for profitable arbitrage

### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains signed investment parameters with fixed `exchangeRateNumerator`
2. Monitors payment token for price movements
3. When price drops significantly:

```solidity
function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
    // Price check absent here
    uint256 preFeeStableAmountEquivalent = (_params.amountToInvest * _params.exchangeRateNumerator) /
        exchangeRateDenominator;
    // Execute investment at old rate
}
```


4. Executes investment using devalued tokens at the original higher exchange rate

### Impact

- Project receives fewer dollars worth of investment than intended
- Creates unfair advantage over fiat investors
- Particularly risky with volatile tokens or during market stress

### Mitigation

Implement on-chain price oracle integration:

```solidity
interface IPriceOracle {
    function getExchangeRate(address token) external view returns (uint256);
}

function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
    uint256 currentRate = oracle.getExchangeRate(_params.paymentTokenAddress);
    require(
        currentRate >= _params.exchangeRateNumerator * 95 / 100,
        "Price deviation too high"
    );
    // Continue with investment
}
```
