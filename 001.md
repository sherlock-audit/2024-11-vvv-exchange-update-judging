# Attacker can steal all claims

### Summary
Within `VVVVCTokenDistributor`  it is expected that any alias of a KYC address can claim their token. The problem is that it is never verified that said address is a legitimate alias of the KYC'd address and also that they receive the tokens (instead of the KYC'd address).

```solidity
    function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
        if (claimIsPaused) {
            revert ClaimIsPaused();
        }

        if (_params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length != _params.tokenAmountsToClaim.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

        // define token to transfer
        IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);

        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

        emit VCClaim(
            _params.kycAddress,
            _params.projectTokenAddress,
            _params.projectTokenProxyWallets,
            _params.tokenAmountsToClaim,
            _params.nonce
        );
    }
```

This basically allows anyone to call the function with a legitimate signature and steal all of the funds intended for the VCs.

### Root Cause
Lack of access control.


### Attack Path
1. Signer gives a signature to the user so they can claim their funds.
2. User submits their transaction trying to claim their funds
3. A malicious user front-runs them and uses the signature to steal the funds.
4. The malicious user can perform the attack for any eligible for rewards user.

### Impact
Loss of funds

### Mitigation

Add access control or always send the funds to the KYC'd address.
