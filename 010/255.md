# Incorrect Price Setting in `invest` Function Causes Potential Fund Loss


### Summary

The `invest` function uses `exchangeRateNumerator` to calculate `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` by multiplying it with `amountToInvest`. This represents the value credited to the user after fees are deducted.


However, `exchangeRateNumerator` is determined off-chain and does not rely on a real-time price oracle. This discrepancy can result in an inaccurate calculation of `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent`.

### Root Cause

The off-chain setting of `exchangeRateNumerator` introduces a lag between on-chain execution and the actual market price.

### Internal Preconditions

- A user initiates the `invest` function with an amount to invest.

### External Preconditions

- The exchange rate set off-chain differs from the actual market price during the transaction execution on-chain.

### Attack path

1. A user attempts to invest 10 USDC, and the `exchangeRateNumerator` is set to 1.2.
2. The transaction is processed on-chain when the actual market price of USDC drops to 0.996 USD (or even a more severe depegged value, such as 0.7 USD).
3. The user capitalizes on the price discrepancy by purchasing at the lower market price and investing at the more favorable off-chain rate.

### Impact

This mismatch between the on-chain and off-chain rates creates an unfair advantage for some users and can result in financial losses for the protocol due to incorrectly valued investments.

### Mitigation

Integrate a reliable price oracle to fetch real-time exchange rates, ensuring accurate updates to `exchangeRateNumerator`. This approach eliminates reliance on static, off-chain values and aligns the on-chain calculations with the current market price.
