# Flawed Price Calculation in `invest` Function Could Lead to Loss of Funds

### Summary

`preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` depends on `exchangeRateNumerator` which is set off-chain
a user trying to invest on-chain with `invest` will not recieve the same price as the off-chain investors, if any lags happen between setting the `exchangeRAteNumerator` and the execution on-chain, leading to potential miscalculations of `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent`.

### Root Cause

The primary issue stems from the off-chain determination of `exchangeRateNumerator`, which can create a discrepancy between the set value and the actual market rate at the time of transaction execution.

### Internal Preconditions  
- A user triggers the `invest` function, providing an amount to invest.  

### External Preconditions

- The off-chain `exchangeRateNumerator` does not match the real-time market price during the transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A user invests 100 USDC, with the `exchangeRateNumerator` fixed at 1.2.  
2. When the transaction is executed on-chain, the real market price of USDC has dropped to 0.996 USD (or a significantly lower value, e.g., 0.8 USD).  
3. The user benefits from this mismatch by buying USDC at the lower market rate and investing at the more favorable off-chain exchange rate.

### Impact

The inconsistency between the on-chain execution and off-chain rate settings can create opportunities for exploitation, giving some users undue profit while causing financial damage to the protocol.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this risk, integrate a trusted price oracle for real-time exchange rate updates. This ensures that the `exchangeRateNumerator` reflects accurate market conditions, eliminating reliance on static, off-chain values and aligning the investment calculations with up-to-date prices.
