# Unauthorized actors will bypass KYC validation to perform investment transfers

### Summary

The `invest` function facilitates a KYC address's investment in a project, but the current implementation of signature validation allows multiple unauthorized addresses to use a single signature within its validity window, potentially bypassing KYC checks. Since the signature can be reused before its expiration (`deadline`), any address can submit an investment on behalf of the KYC address, leading to unauthorized transfers. This introduces significant risks in investment processes, especially concerning regulatory compliance and financial integrity.

### Root Cause

- The current signature-based validation allows any address to use a KYC address's signature within the signature's validity period.
- The absence of a mechanism to limit or check for the reuse of signatures across different addresses exposes the system to potential misuse.
- The function does not sufficiently bind the signature to a specific `msg.sender`, making it possible for anyone to execute the `invest` function with a valid signature.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `invest` function is designed to facilitate investments only from KYC-approved addresses.
- The signature is tied to the `kycAddress` and is expected to be unique for each transaction.
- The `deadline` ensures the signature is only valid for a limited period.

### External pre-conditions

- The signature for an investment is valid within a given timeframe (before the `deadline`).
- Any address can obtain and use the valid signature within the allowed time window to submit an investment transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A valid signature for the `invest` function is generated for a specific `kycAddress`.
2. Since the signature is valid for a period before the `deadline`, it can be reused by any unauthorized address.
3. An unauthorized actor (anyone) submits an investment transaction, using the same signature, without KYC validation or restriction on which address can use it.
4. The transaction is processed successfully, bypassing the KYC verification, and the investment is made.

### Impact

The vulnerability in the `invest` function exposes the project to severe risks, undermining the core functionality intended by the project's KYC requirements. Since the project specifically requires KYC compliance, it is evident that regulatory adherence is a high priority. However, the current design of the `invest` function allows unauthorized actors to bypass these checks entirely, which directly contradicts the project's goal of ensuring regulatory compliance.

This creates a significant risk of unauthorized investments, which could potentially involve money laundering or other illicit activities. Furthermore, this vulnerability could enable malicious actors, such as those on government sanction lists or involved in criminal activities, to send funds to the project. Accepting such transactions could expose the project to legal and financial consequences, including substantial fines or other penalties from regulatory bodies such as the US OFAC or the European Union.

Although this issue may not immediately result in a direct financial loss, the severity lies in the breakdown of core functionality. The project's ability to control and validate investments is compromised, which is a critical failure. The potential for financial loss exists in the form of fines, penalties, and the damage to the project's reputation. This issue represents a medium-severity vulnerability because it disrupts a core contract function—investment processing—putting the entire project's operational integrity at risk.

### PoC

1. Obtain a valid signature for a KYC-approved address.
2. Submit an investment transaction using this signature from a different, unauthorized address.
3. Observe that the investment is successfully processed despite the address not being KYC-approved.

### Mitigation

- Introduce a mechanism to bind the signature to the `msg.sender`, ensuring that only the KYC address (or its authorized representative) can submit the transaction.
- Implement a nonce-based or timestamp validation system that prevents the reuse of signatures by unauthorized parties.
- Consider implementing a stricter KYC check within the `invest` function, such as verifying the identity of the `msg.sender` directly against the KYC database or using an additional authorization mechanism to limit signature reuse.
