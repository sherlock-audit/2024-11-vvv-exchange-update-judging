# Missing Investment Round Limit Check in `addInvestmentRecords`

### Summary

The `addInvestmentRecords` function does not enforce the `investmentRoundLimit`. This allows an authorized user to bypass investment limits and arbitrarily inflate the total invested amount for any round, compromising the integrity of the investment tracking.

### Root Cause


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256C4-L277C6
doesn't check if the added amounts exceed the specified investmentRoundLimit for the given round.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Authorized User Call: An authorized user (e.g., an administrator) calls the `addInvestmentRecords` function.
2. Excessive Investment Amount: The user provides `_amountsToInvest` values that, when added to the existing `totalInvestedPerRound`, exceed the defined `investmentRoundLimit` for the corresponding round.
3. Unrestricted Addition: The contract accepts the excessive investment amounts without checking against the limit.
4. Inflated Investment Total: The `totalInvestedPerRound` mapping is updated with the inflated values, misrepresenting the actual investments.
Example:

Let's assume the `investmentRoundLimit` for round 1 is set to 1,000,000 units. An attacker calls `addInvestmentRecords` and attempts to add 2,000,000 units to round 1. The contract accepts this input without checking against the limit, resulting in totalInvestedPerRound[1] being incorrectly set to a value exceeding the limit.



### Impact

Vulnerability allows manipulation of the recorded investment totals, misrepresenting the actual investment status.

### Mitigation
Implement a check within the `addInvestmentRecords` function's loop to enforce the `investmentRoundLimit`.
```solidity 
 // Enforce investment round limit:
        require(
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] + amountToInvest <= getInvestmentRoundLimit(investmentRound)
            //Investment round limit exceeded
        );

        kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
        totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
```
