# User-controlled exchange rate allows investment amount manipulation

### Summary

The user-controlled exchange rate parameter will cause potential loss of funds for the protocol as malicious users can manipulate the investment amounts by providing arbitrary exchange rates.

### Root Cause

In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol:166` the calculation of the stable coin equivalent amount uses a user-provided `exchangeRateNumerator` without any validation or oracle price check:

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Investment must not be paused (`investmentIsPaused` must be false)
2. The investment round must be active (current timestamp between `investmentRoundStartTimestamp` and `investmentRoundEndTimestamp`)
3. The signer must have signed the investment parameters including the manipulated exchange rate

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates an investment request with a very high `exchangeRateNumerator`
2. Attacker gets this request signed by the signer (who may not notice the manipulated rate)
3. Attacker calls `invest()` with a small `amountToInvest` but inflated `exchangeRateNumerator`
4. The calculation results in a much larger `preFeeStableAmountEquivalent` than should be possible with that investment amount
5. This allows the attacker to claim they've invested more in stable coin terms than they actually have


### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect accounting of investments, where users can claim to have invested more in stable coin terms than they actually have. This could lead to:
1. Unfair allocation of future benefits/tokens based on recorded investment amounts
2. Bypassing of investment round limits
3. Bypassing of individual KYC address allocation limits

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add oracle integration to verify exchange rates
Alternatively, remove user-provided exchange rates entirely and use only oracle prices.
