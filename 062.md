# EIP712 DOMAIN_SEPARATOR stored as immutable which can result in replay attack in case of hard fork

### Summary

EIP712, widely used for structured data signing, incorporates the chainId into the domain separator to prevent replay attacks across networks. However, caching the chainId during contract deployment introduces potential vulnerabilities. If the network undergoes a hard fork and changes its chainId, the cached `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` becomes invalid. This discrepancy can lead to replay attacks, where signatures valid on the original chain may be exploited on the forked chain.

Such implementations are unsafe as they rely on immutable `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` values rather than dynamically recalculating it using the current chainId. This could allow unauthorized orders or transactions to be replayed on forked networks.

### Impact

The use of a cached DOMAIN_SEPARATOR can enable replay attacks if a network undergoes a hard fork, as signatures from the original chain remain valid on the forked chain. This poses a risk of unauthorized transactions.

### PoC

Review the constructors in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol `and `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` contracts.

Both contracts cache the DOMAIN_SEPARATOR in their constructors, which can become invalid if the network undergoes a hard fork.

### Mitigation

To mitigate replay attacks, it is advisable to follow best practices for EIP712 implementation, as demonstrated in OpenZeppelin's [EIP712.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/448efeea6640bbbc09373f03fbc9c88e280147ba/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol#L88).
