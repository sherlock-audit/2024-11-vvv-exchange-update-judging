# Missing logic in VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim enables attackers to steal user funds

### Summary

The missing logic in the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` function can cause a complete loss of funds for users, as an attacker may frontrun their transactions.

### Root Cause

In the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` function, ERC20 tokens are transferred to the `msg.sender` without any restrictions. As a result, `msg.sender` can be anyone. An attacker can exploit this by frontrunning a userâ€™s transaction and claiming all the funds for themselves.

[VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L106) function:
```javascript
function claim(ClaimParams memory _params) public {
    ...
    IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);
    // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
        projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
            _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
=>          msg.sender,
            _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
        );
    }
    ...
}
```

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors transactions in the mempool.
2. A user sends a transaction to claim ERC20 tokens by calling the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` function.
3. The attacker detects this transaction and copies it, submitting it with a higher gas fee.
4. The attacker's transaction is executed before the user's transaction. Consequently, the attacker successfully claims the funds, and the user's transaction fails.

### Impact

Users lose all their funds, which are transferred to the attacker's wallet.

### Mitigation

If the `msg.sender` must be `kycAddress`, update the `VVVVCTokenDistributor::claim` function to enforce this restriction. Otherwise, ensure that `msg.sender` is included as an element in a message signed by the `signer`. When verifying the signature, if the `msg.sender` differs from the intended recipient, the signature will be invalid, and the transaction will revert.
