# Missing active investment round check in admin function `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()` allows admins to add investments for inactive rounds.

### Summary

The [`VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L256-L277) function lacks a check for validating investment round periods, allowing administrators to add investments for inactive rounds.

### Root Cause

The validation for investment round period [exists](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L150-L156) in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` but doesn't exist in `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` must have active and inactive investment rounds.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- An investment round ends, i.e `investmentRoundEndTimestamp` passes(calling `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest` when `block.timestamp` is greater than `investmentRoundEndTimestamp`).
- Admin calls `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()` for an ended investment round.
- Investment is recorded despite round being inactive.

### Impact

- Allows backdating of investments
- Affects regulatory compliance


### Mitigation

Add round activity validation to `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::addInvestmentRecords()`:

    /**
        @notice Allows admin to add multiple investment records to the ledger

     */
    function addInvestmentRecords(
        address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
        uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
        uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
    ) external onlyAuthorized {
        if (
            _kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length ||
            _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length
        ) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
            // check round activity
            if (block.timestamp < _startTimestamps[i] || block.timestamp > _endTimestamps[i]) {
            revert InactiveInvestmentRound();
        }
            address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
            uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
            uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

            kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
            emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
        }
    }
