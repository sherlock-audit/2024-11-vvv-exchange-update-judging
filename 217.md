# MEV Bots will front-run the claim() function

### Summary

In the smartcontract `VVVVCTokenDistributor`, the fonction `claim()` is write without verifying that the the legitimate user is the one who receive the tokens.

### Root Cause

In the `claim()` function, the `safeTransferfrom` transfer funds directly to the msg.sender without verifying that he is allowed to claim these tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

- One user can claim his tokens with a legitimate signature

### External pre-conditions
- Front-run is possible on the chain where the protocol is deployed (ETH mainnet)
- One user claims his tokens by using the `claim()` function with a valid signature.

### Attack Path

1. Alice obtains a valid signature to claim tokens and call the `claim()` function.
2. MEV bot detects the transaction in mempool and copy the signature from the transaction.
3. Bot front-runs using same signature, and receive the Alice's funds
4. Alice can never receive his tokens because the transaction failed as the tokens were already claimed.

### Impact

High severity:
- An user loose all his due tokens.
- Every users are subject to the attack.

### Mitigation

Add a `require()` who verify that the msg.sender is the kycAddress or someone who can claim.
