# In `VVVVCInvestmentLedger` `exchangeRateNumerator` is prone to price changes

### Summary
`exchangeRateNumerator` is recorded off-chain and signed by the centralized system, but its undermined that price can change alot during the `deadline` window which will give arbitrage opportunity and cause loss of funds to project that invested


### Root Cause
`exchangeRateNumerator` is derived off-chain and not taking into consideration the price changes between order signing and order on-chain execution


### Internal pre-conditions
User submitted a request to invest in a project and `exchangeRateNumerator` was inserted by the off-chain mechanism


### External pre-conditions
a sharp decrease of the price of the invested token happens, can be a depeg event for stable coins too during the duration of the `deadline`


### Attack Path
1. User submit a request to invest 100 USDC
2. `exchangeRateNumerator` is set to 1.3
3. User wait 2 blocks for example, USDC depeg happens, and he gets usdc for 0.6 USD
   > _*Note!*_: it doesn't have to be a depegg, since usdc can have 0.996 USD price in normal circumstances
4. user buy the USDC and invest at the same `exchangeRateNumerator` with the new discounted price


### Impact
Loss of funds to the project that gets the investment, unfair price for users that use off-chain fiat investments, cause in this circumstance it would be more cheap to invest with usdc on-chain

Impact can be greater for tokens with high volatility other than usdc, those tokens are not weird as assumed by the audit readMe


### Mitigation
implement an oracle to retrieve on-chain price and do changes to  `exchangeRateNumerator` accordingly
