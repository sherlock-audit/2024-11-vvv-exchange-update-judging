# Nonce verification is not performed in sequential order.

### Summary

In the `claim` function, the nonce check is not strictly enforced in sequential order, which may lead to frontrunning attacks or re-org and render some users' signatures invalid.

### Root Cause

In the `claim` function, the nonce check does not enforce a strictly incremental requirement.
```solidity
        if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

```

### Attack Path

1. The user receives two signatures with `nonce=1` and `nonce=2` and can either initiate sequential transactions to execute these two claims or combine both `claim` calls into a single atomic transaction.
2. For the first scenario, if a block reorganization occurs and the transaction with `nonce=2` is executed first, the contract will update the user's `nonce` to 2. When the transaction with `nonce=1` is later executed, it will fail (`revert`) because the `nonce` in the contract no longer matches the `nonce` in the signature, making the transaction invalid.
3. For the second scenario, a malicious actor can front-run the user's `nonce=2` signautre claim transaction. Once the malicious claim is executed, the user's `nonce` in the contract will be updated to 2. Consequently, the user's own `nonce=2` claim transaction will fail due to a nonce mismatch, and their `nonce=1` claim transaction will also be invalidated because the contract's `nonce` has already been advanced, preventing it from being executed.

### Impact

Some of the user's signatures for specific nonces may become invalid and cannot be executed, leading to potential financial losses.

### Mitigation

```diff
-       if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
+       if (_params.nonce == nonces[_params.kycAddress] + 1) {
            revert InvalidNonce();
        }

        if (!_isSignatureValid(_params)) {
            revert InvalidSignature();
        }

        // update nonce
        nonces[_params.kycAddress] = _params.nonce;

```
