# H-1: Incorrect Nonce Validation Allows Replay Attacks

### Summary

The incorrect validation of the nonce in` the claim` function allows attackers to replay valid claims. By setting `_params.nonce` to the current or previously used nonce for a KYC address, the attacker bypasses claim safeguards, resulting in double claims or token theft.

### Root Cause

In `VVVCTokenDistributor.sol:115` in `the claim` function:
```solidity
if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
    revert InvalidNonce();
}
```
The condition only ensures that `_params.nonce` is greater than or equal to the stored nonce. However, this does not enforce strict monotonic incrementing, which allows attackers to reuse a valid nonce or use arbitrary larger nonces.

### Internal pre-conditions

1- `nonces[_params.kycAddress]` tracks the latest nonce processed for each KYC address.
2 - `_params.nonce` is submitted by the user as part of the claim request.
3- The claim function checks `_params.nonce` against `nonces[_params.kycAddress]`.


### External pre-conditions

1- An attacker has access to a valid signature associated with a prior claim request for a specific KYC address.
2- The off-chain centralized system signs `_params.nonce` values without enforcing monotonicity.

### Attack Path

1 - The attacker submits a valid claim using _params.nonce = X where X>`nonces[_params.kycAddress]`
2- After the claim is processed, `nonces[_params.kycAddress]` is updated to ùëã
3- The attacker reuses the same signature with `_params.nonce `= X or any larger value (e.g. X+1), which again passes the check:
```solidity
if (_params.nonce <= nonces[_params.kycAddress]) {
    revert InvalidNonce(); // Incorrectly allows nonce reuse.
}
```
4 - The attacker repeats the process, successfully claiming tokens multiple times.

### Impact

# Affected Party: 
The protocol and its users.
# Token Theft:
The attacker claims tokens repeatedly using the same or incremented nonce, leading to double-spending.
Token reserves in `projectTokenProxyWallets` are drained, impacting legitimate claimants.
# Severity: High.
This issue directly undermines the integrity of the claim process, causing severe financial loss to the protocol and its participants.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce Strict Monotonic Incrementing for Nonces:
```solidity
if (_params.nonce != nonces[_params.kycAddress] ) {
    revert InvalidNonce();
}
