# Investors can avoid paying protocol fee

### Summary

Investors can call the function `VVVVCInvestmentLedger::invest()` as much time as they want within the time interval till the deadline. Instead of investing all the amount in one time they can call the `invest()` function with small amount of token whichs usd equivalent is less than `FEE_DENOMINATOR` to avoid paying protocol fee.

### Root Cause

Investors can invest multiple times with the same signature and the `investmentAmount` is not the part of digest and signature.
To calculate the protocol fee we are dividing it by `FEE_DENOMINATOR`, but investor can invest in small amount to avoid paying the protocol fee as there is no minimum amount of investment set.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Signer signed the signature for the investor to invest

### External pre-conditions

1. Investor uses the signature and `_params` to invest.

### Attack Path

1. Signer signed the param and signature for the investors to invest
2. Investors invest multiple times in small amount to avoid paying protocol fees.

### Impact

Investors can avoid paying protocol fee which breaks one the of the main invariants that the protocol is expect a fee amount on every investment

```javascript
    function invest(InvestParams memory _params) external {
        .
        .
        .
        uint256 postFeeStableAmountEquivalent =
            preFeeStableAmountEquivalent - (preFeeStableAmountEquivalent * _params.feeNumerator) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
    }
```

### Mitigation

set a minimum investmentAmount and below which it should revert.
