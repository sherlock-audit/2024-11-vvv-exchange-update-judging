# ChainId is hardcoded in the calculation of the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` within the constructor, which can enable replay attacks in case of a hard fork.

### Summary

In both `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol` and `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol`, the `chainId` used to calculate the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` for EIP712 is set in the constructor, making it hardcoded. This poses a risk in the event of a hard fork, as the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` value would become invalid. If the `chainId` remains the same after a hard fork, it could lead to incorrect behavior and potential replay attacks.

### Root Cause

We'll use `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` to illustrate the issue, but the same concern applies to `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol`.

The [constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/1791f41b310489aaa66de349ef1b9e4bd331f14b/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L84-L100) is implemented as follows:
```solidity
constructor(
        address _signer,
        string memory _environmentTag,
        address _authorizationRegistryAddress,
        uint256 _exchangeRateDenominator
    ) VVVAuthorizationRegistryChecker(_authorizationRegistryAddress) {
        signer = _signer;
        exchangeRateDenominator = _exchangeRateDenominator;

        // EIP-712 domain separator
        DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
            abi.encode(
                DOMAIN_TYPEHASH,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked("VVV", _environmentTag)),
@>              block.chainid,
                address(this)
            )
        );
    }
```
1. As we can see the `chainId` is derived and then hardcoded in `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`.

2. This means even after hard fork, `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` value will remain same and point to incorrect `chainId`.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform replay attacks, such as calling `claim()` in both chains.

According to the protocol specifications, it will be deployed across 6 different chains, increasing the potential impact of this issue.
> Eth, base, bnb, avalanche, polkadot, arbitrum

This heightens the risk that a hard fork could enable replay attacks.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

Chain hard fork. 

### Attack Path

1. A chain undergoes a hard fork.
2. An attacker exploits the fork by executing a replay attack across chains calling `claim()`.
3. The attacker claims rewards twice: once on the main chain and again on the forked chain.

### Impact

A hard fork would enable the possibility of replay attacks.

### PoC

The preceding sections demonstrated this issue.

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` should be dynamically recomputed using the current `chainId` value each time.
