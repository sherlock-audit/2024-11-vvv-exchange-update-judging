# Users front-running admins who change contract parameters

### Summary

The `addInvestmentRecords` function lacks validation for `kycAddressAllocation` and `totalInvestedPerRound`, allowing users to exploit a mismatch between the investment round limits and KYC-specific allocations. This results in users surpassing their allocation limits and blocking others from participating in the investment round.

### Root Cause

The `addInvestmentRecords` function directly updates `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` and `totalInvestedPerRound` without enforcing checks on the maximum limits of `kycAddressAllocation` or `investmentRoundLimit`.
- Users can front-run admin updates by strategically investing after an admin call but before validations are applied.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Admin calls `addInvestmentRecords` to update ledger records.

### Attack Path

Setup: 
- The round limit (`investmentRoundLimit`) is 15,000 USDT.
- The current `totalInvestedPerRound` is 12,000 USDT.
- Charlie has a `kycAddressAllocation` of 2,000 USDT, but he has not invested yet.
- David also has a `kycAddressAllocation` of 1,000 USDT and has not invested yet.

- The admin calls `addInvestmentRecords` to pre-record 1,500 USDT as an investment for Charlie.

1. Charlie front-runs by immediately investing 2,000 USDT, reaching his `kycAddressAllocation`.
2. This results in:
   - Charlie's total allocation = 1,500 USDT (admin-added) + 2,000 USDT (self-invested) = 3,500 USDT.
   - Charlie's allocation cap of 2,000 USDT is surpassed.

Consequence:
- The total investments for the round are now:
  - 12,000 USDT (previous total) + 1,500 USDT (admin-added for Charlie) + 2,000 USDT (Charlie's self-investment) = 15,500 USDT.
- The `totalInvestedPerRound` exceeds the round limit of **15,000 USDT.
- When David attempts to invest his allocation of 1,000 USDT, the contract blocks his investment because the `totalInvestedPerRound` has already surpassed the cap.

### Impact

1. Some users are unfairly locked out of investing due to inflated `totalInvestedPerRound`.
2. Other users can exceed their `kycAddressAllocation`, creating inconsistencies and trust issues.
3. Violates the intended investment round rules, undermining fairness and predictability.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

1. Validation Checks in `addInvestmentRecords`:
   - Ensure that the updated `kycAddressInvestedPerRound` does not exceed `kycAddressAllocation`.
   - Ensure that the updated `totalInvestedPerRound` does not exceed `investmentRoundLimit`.

2. Lock State During Admin Updates:
   - Introduce a temporary lock mechanism when `addInvestmentRecords` is called, preventing user investments until the admin operation completes.

3. Revised Code Example:

```solidity
function addInvestmentRecords(
    address[] calldata _kycAddresses,
    uint256[] calldata _investmentRounds,
    uint256[] calldata _amountsToInvest
) external onlyAuthorized {
    if (
        _kycAddresses.length != _investmentRounds.length ||
        _investmentRounds.length != _amountsToInvest.length
    ) {
        revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
    }

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _kycAddresses.length; i++) {
        address kycAddress = _kycAddresses[i];
        uint256 investmentRound = _investmentRounds[i];
        uint256 amountToInvest = _amountsToInvest[i];

        // Validate against limits
        if (kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] + amountToInvest > kycAddressAllocation[kycAddress]) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }
        if (totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] + amountToInvest > investmentRoundLimit) {
            revert ExceedsAllocation();
        }

        // Update records
        kycAddressInvestedPerRound[kycAddress][investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
        totalInvestedPerRound[investmentRound] += amountToInvest;
        
        emit VCInvestment(investmentRound, address(0), kycAddress, 0, 0, 0, amountToInvest);
    }
}
