# Denial Of Service (DOS) via `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.invest()` front-running call

### Summary

An attacker can invest in place of a legitimate investor, which will deplete the amount specified in `InvestParams.kycAddressAllocation`, which is the maximum amount the KYC address can invest.

### Root Cause

The [VVVVCInvestmentLedger.invest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L141) function [checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L175) the investment amount available for the investor to deposit within the round using the [kycAddressAllocation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L67) parameter (the value is set off-chain).

However, it’s worth noting two important details:
1. When [verifying the signature from the signer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L212), the transaction `msg.sender` is not taken into signer. This means anyone can call the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.invest()` function.
2. When [verifying the signature from the signer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L212), the `InvestParams.amountToInvest` parameter is not taken into signer. This means the attacker can read the investor's transaction from the public mempool, take the investor's signature, and replace the `InvestParams.amountToInvest` with any value, even zero.

## `amountToInvest` equal to zero

This will not cause a failure but will allow the `invest()` function to be called an unlimited number of times until the signature `deadline` expires. In turn, this will enable emitting an unlimited number of events. Anyone subscribed to the event will receive spam [VCInvestment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L85C11-L85C23) events. For example, this could affect the collection of statistical data.

## `amountToInvest > 0`

An attacker can use their own assets (which might be illicit) to invest in place of the legitimate investor. Under certain `InvestParams` settings, this could lead to the depletion of the investor's personal limit according to the `InvestParams.kycAddressAllocation` parameter and the round's overall limit `InvestParams.totalInvestedPerRound`.

It’s worth noting that the `InvestParams.deadline` parameter will not protect against this attack, as the attacker will attempt to front-run the investor’s transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

The protocol must establish several conditions that will be reasonable for the attack. The following [InvestParams](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L60) will be considered when calling the `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.invest()` function:
1. `investmentRoundLimit`
2. `kycAddressAllocation`
3. `paymentTokenAddress`


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The legitimate investor's transaction will be reverted, and they will not be able to invest their assets according to their allowed allocation.

### PoC

1. Take the test and insert it into `VVVVCInvestmentLedger.unit.t.sol`.
    ```solidity
    function testInvest_amountToDenialOfService() public {
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        uint256 amountToInvest = userPaymentTokenDefaultAllocation;
    
        VVVVCInvestmentLedger.InvestParams memory params = generateInvestParamsWithSignature(
            sampleInvestmentRoundIds[0],
            investmentRoundSampleLimit,
            amountToInvest,
            userPaymentTokenDefaultAllocation,
            exchangeRateNumerator,
            feeNumerator,
            sampleKycAddress,
            activeRoundStartTimestamp,
            activeRoundEndTimestamp
        );
    
        PaymentTokenInstance.mint(attacker, amountToInvest);
        investAsUser(attacker, params);
    
        investAsUser(sampleUser, params); // revert ExceedsAllocation()
    }
    ```
2. Run command `forge test -vvv --mt testInvest_amountToDenialOfService`

As a result of the test, we will see that the investor was unable to invest, and a `ExceedsAllocation()` revert will occur. The attacker invested in place of the legitimate investor.

### Mitigation

The [_isSignatureValid()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCInvestmentLedger.sol#L212) function must take into account the transaction `msg.sender` and `amountToInvest`.

```diff
bytes32 public constant INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH = ... ; // TODO: add  msg.sender and amountToInvest

function _isSignatureValid(InvestParams memory _params) internal view returns (bool) {
    bytes32 digest = keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
            "\x19\x01",
            DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    INVESTMENT_TYPEHASH,
+                    msg.sender,
+                   _params.amountToInvest,
                    _params.investmentRound,
                    _params.investmentRoundLimit,
                    _params.investmentRoundStartTimestamp,
                    _params.investmentRoundEndTimestamp,
                    _params.paymentTokenAddress,
                    _params.kycAddress,
                    _params.kycAddressAllocation,
                    _params.exchangeRateNumerator,
                    _params.feeNumerator,
                    _params.deadline
                )
            )
        )
    );

   ...
}
```
