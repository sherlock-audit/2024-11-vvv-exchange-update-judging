# `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol::Claim` function can be frontrun by an Attacker, which will result in tokens being transfered to the Attacker.

### Summary

When an alias of an KYC-address calls the `claim` function inside VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol, the transaction will get sent to the mempool which makes it possible for an attacker to frontrun and get the ProjectTokens that are avaliable for claim as the params("signature")  is published to the mempool.

### Root Cause

This arises when the signer/alias trying to claim will broadcast the params("signature") to the mempool which the attacker can use to frontrun the signer/alias.

Because the claim function does not check if the msg.sender is a legitimate alias of an KYC address. it only checks if the recovered address from `ECDSA.recover` is the same as the signer address

This will cause everyone being able to use the signature as there no checks at all to see if the user is affiliated with a KYC address.


`ClaimParams`

```solidity
   struct ClaimParams {
        address kycAddress;
        address projectTokenAddress;
        address[] projectTokenProxyWallets;
        uint256[] tokenAmountsToClaim;
        uint256 nonce;
        uint256 deadline;
        bytes signature; <-
    }
```

`VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol:_IsSignatureValid` 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L157-#L176

```solidity
        address recoveredAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, _params.signature);
        bool isSigner = recoveredAddress == signer;
        bool isExpired = block.timestamp > _params.deadline;
        return isSigner && !isExpired;
    }
```


This will cause the attacker to steal the projectTokens meant for the intial `msg.sender` .(signer/alias)


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L126-#L136

```solidity
        // define token to transfer
        IERC20 projectToken = IERC20(_params.projectTokenAddress);


        // transfer tokens from each wallet to the caller
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _params.projectTokenProxyWallets.length; i++) {
            projectToken.safeTransferFrom(
                _params.projectTokenProxyWallets[i],
                msg.sender,
                _params.tokenAmountsToClaim[i]
            );
        }

```

The attacker will receive the amount of projectTokens meant for the initial caller.


### Internal pre-conditions

User/alias with the signature from the `signer` needs to call `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol::Claim`

### External pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. an Alias of a KYC address sends the transaction to the mempool with the right signature.
2. Attacker sees the transaction being sent in the mempool with the params which includes the signature.
3. Attacker frontruns the transaction by putting a much bigger gwei.
4. Attacker receives the amountOfTokens that was meant for  an Alias of a KYC address.

### Impact

The protocol will lose the amount that the caller/alias was trying to claim, the amount could also rise to the approval limit this contract has over the `projectTokensProxyWallets` as it could be a lot more than what the initial msg.sender with the signature was trying to claim.

### PoC

Manual review

### Mitigation

Implement a way to control who can claim with the signature
