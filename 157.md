# Insufficient Balance Verification in Claims

### Summary

[place of issue](github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L64)
A lack of balance verification in `claim` processing will cause potential fund shortages for claimants if the off-chain system fails to maintain balances, leading to claim reversion or partial claims.

### Root Cause

In `VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol` ([place of issue](github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-vvv-exchange-update/blob/main/vvv-platform-smart-contracts/contracts/vc/VVVVCTokenDistributor.sol#L64)), the contract assumes all `projectTokenProxyWallets` have sufficient balances without verifying available balances before attempting token transfers.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The centralized off-chain system fails to ensure that each `projectTokenProxyWallet` has enough tokens for the requested claim.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A claimant calls `claim` with `_params.projectTokenProxyWallets` containing underfunded wallets.

2. The contract attempts to transfer tokens from these wallets, causing partial or full reversion of the claim due to insufficient funds.

### Impact

Claimants are unable to complete their claims, potentially suffering a loss of expected distributions, while the protocol may face reputational risks due to failed claims.
